We find Claire Tanner, Danny, DJ, and Stephanie in the front room. Claire is about to leave...
Claire: If you need me, I'm on the next plane.
Danny: Aw, thank you, mom.
Claire: Okay.
DJ & Stephanie: Bye, Grandma.
Danny: Bye, mom.
Claire: Bye.
DJ & Stephanie: Bye.
Claire: Oh, my angels!
Stephanie: Grandma, don't leave!
Claire: I love you. Goodbye, sweetheart.
Stephanie: Goodbye, grandma.
Claire: Bye. Bye.
DJ, Steph, Danny: Bye
Claire leaves
Danny: Okay! Are we going to have fun or what? (DJ & Stephanie frown) Hey, hey, hey! Let's see some smiles. Everything is going to work out super great. Your uncle Jesse is moving in; my best friend Joey is moving in, and you know what that means... That means that you two are going to get to be roommates. Isn't that exciting?
Stephanie: I can wear all DJ's clothes!
DJ: Do I have to share my room with her?
Danny: Honey, it's going to be just like having a slumber party.
DJ: Yeah, with only one guest... who never leaves!
Jesse enters.
Jesse: Hey! Look alive! Uncle Jesse's here!
DJ & Stephanie: Uncle Jesse!
Jesse: (imitating the girls) Uncle Jesse! (in his normal voice) All right! Hello! DJ, how you doing? That tooth come in yet?
DJ: Nah.
Jesse: That's okay; one less to brush.
Danny: Hey, Jesse!
Jesse: Danno!
Danny: You missed breakfast; where have you been?
Jesse: I know; sorry. Last night, after my gig at the smash club, I go for a cruise on my Harley, right? Nest thing I know, I'm in Reno. It was dark - who would have known? Then, I happened to wander into this show, Razzle Dazzle '87 - much better than Razzle Dazzle '86, by the way. And I see this incredible showgirl Vanessa, right? Our eyes meet. (Danny looks at the girls, concerned at what they might be hearing) Ba-boom, this lightning bolt of passion shoots across the casino. Turns out, Vanessa is on her way to the Philippines to do a Bob Hope special, and is dying for one last night of good old American -
Danny: Food, food! She was hungry, right?
Jesse: Oh yeah. She was starving. Only we never got a chance to, uh, "eat," because she had to turn her feathers in.
Stephanie: Uncle Jesse, let's play Ballerina.
Jesse: Uncle Jesse doesn't want to play ballerina.
Stephanie: Yes he does...
Jesse: No he doesn't...
Stephanie: Yes he does...
Jesse: No he doesn't!
Stephanie: (pretending to cry) Yes he does.
Jesse: How do you play ballerina?
Stephanie: Dance!
Jesse: Okay, that was fun.
Joey enters carrying a pile of laundry, and makes a noise, imitating a trumpet
DJ: Hi, Joey.
Joey: Hi, Danny.
Danny: Oh, Joey, buddy. This is the best; you're moving in! (Danny takes the pile of laundry from Joey)
Joey: Thanks, Danny. This works out so perfect. I move into a place with a washing machine on the exact day I run out of clean clothes. (Danny drops the pile of laundry, which he now knows to be dirty) Jesse, long time no see. Now be honest. Did you ever think we'd end up being roommates?
Jesse: Not once.
Joey: I love this guy. Danny, there's no way all my stuff will fit into a room this tiny.
Danny: Joey, this is not a tiny room. This is a large alcove. In fact, this is a large alcove that you're living in for free.


Joey: You know, now that I take a close look at it, it's enormous... 'normous... 'normous... We are gonna have so much fun, aren't we, kids? (imitates Popeye's laugh)
DJ: Do you think we could catch grandma at the airport?
Danny and Jesse are walking in the upstairs hallway. They enter Jesse's new room...
Danny: Nice, huh? Roomy. (Jesse looks at the pink bunnies on the wall) Not overly masculine.
Jesse: Oh golly, it's swell. You know what would look great over here by the window? Barbie's dream house.
Danny: We've got one. Look, Jesse, I just want you to know that having you and Joey here really means a lot to me. Just knowing somebody's here who cares about the girls. You know, they're so happy you're here. Oh, God bless you! (Danny hugs Jesse)
Jesse: You're hugging me in a room with pink bunnies.
Danny: Oh, sorry. I'm an emotional guy. Okay, let's face it. I'm a lean, mean, hugging machine.
Jesse: Okay. Danny, listen; Pam was my big sister, and I loved her very much, and I love your kids, and I'm happy to do what I can. (Danny hugs Jesse again) Aah, you're hugging me again. Now listen; you and me, we'll sit down; we'll set aside a special time for hugging. But not now. (Jesse opens the closet, and sees that the closet rack is too low) Oh great, I live in Webster's room!


DJ and Stephanie are in their new bedroom, which they now have to share...
DJ: Rule number one : never touch my stuff. You should be taking notes. Rule number two : never set foot in my half of the room.
Stephanie: How do I get out of here?
DJ: Easy. You jump off the window and climb down the tree.
Stephanie: I don't think so.
DJ: Suit yourself.
Stephanie: I'll find a way out... (Stephanie climes onto the window curtain)
Danny and Jesse enter the room
Danny: Stephanie, what are you doing?
Stephanie: Just hanging around.
Danny: Come on, honey, get down from there.
Joey enters
Joey: (seeing the yellow barrier tied across the room) All right! Limbo. Dika-laka-puka... dika-laka-puka... dika-laka-puka... no way.
DJ: This is a nightmare.
Danny: Uh, DJ, honey, I told you everything is gonna work out super great. I'm sorry. I've got to get down to the station. Try to watch my sports report this afternoon. Today starts my special two-part series entitled, "Boxers : Highly Skilled Athletes or Bullies in Shorts?"


Jesse and Joey are in Michelle's nursery, where Michelle is crying
Joey: (in a baby's voice) Oh, Michelle, little baby waby. What's the matter? Uncle Jesse, what are we gonna do?
Jesse: First, we stop talking like a munchkin. (Michelle continues to cry) Hey, shut up!
Joey: Wait, I'll handle this. I'm a comic; it's my non-paying job to cheer people up. (imitating Kermit the Frog) Uh, Michelle, it's me, Kermit the frog. Now, uh, you don't want to cry, do ya? (Michelle continues to cry) Wait, she'll love it. I call it, "The Sprinkler." (Joey drinks water, and starts to spit it out, like a sprinkler. Meanwhile, Jesse grabs a little umbrella and covers Michelle) Tough room. Jesse, what if she needs to be... uh... changed?
Jesse: Check it out. Go.
Joey: (looking at the inside of the diaper) We have a winner. Now what?
Jesse: Joseph. Put yourself in her place. What would you want done?
Joey: I've never changed a diaper.
Jesse: Me neither. At least you touched one. All right, look out; I'll show you how it's done. (to Michelle) Come here child. You believe this guy? (to Joey) All right, make yourself useful.
Joey: I'll take the south end.
Jesse: Good.
Jesse and Joey walk out of the room, heading down the stairs, into the front room, and then into the kitchen Joey &
Jesse: Step one, step two, step one, step two, step one, step two, step one, step two.
Jesse: Okay, good. Look out. Okay, keep it coming.
Stephanie: (in the front room) Showtime!
Joey: (in the kitchen) Where will we put the baby?
Jesse: Where will we put the child?
Joey: Uh, the pot, over here.
Jesse: Whoa... whoa... whoa... whoa... whoa... whoa! Joey, this is a living thing. You don't stick it in a pot; use a meat rack.
Joey: I'm an idiot.
Jesse: Uh, come on.
Joey: Okay.
Jesse: All right, good.
Joey: All right, great.
Jesse: Settle down here; here we go.
Stephanie: Are you gonna cook Michelle?
Joey: We're changing her diaper.
Stephanie: Oh, then how do you roast a turkey?
Jesse: Steph! Joey and I are busy. Joey, strip her. All right, careful there. You're in control. All right, slide it off and... ugh!
Joey: Uh... uh... (puts the dirty diaper into a plastic bowl and covers the bowl)
Jesse: Good thinking, Joey, keep it fresh.
Joey: Okay, hold her up; I'll clean her off.
Jesse: Good idea. Come on, Michelle, all right. (Joey tries to shoot water at Michelle to clean her off...) You're missing! You're missing! You're missing! All right now, come on, gently now, gently now, gently... There we go. This is great; we should be mothers.
Joey: Oh, yeah.
Jesse: All right, let's dry her up.
Joey: Okay. Fan her. Fan her fanny. Fan her fanny.
Joey: You know these babies have it made? I would kill for this kind of service.
Jesse: All right, diapers.
Joey: Diaper... diaper
Jesse: Where are diapers?
Joey: Diapers...
Jesse: Diapers...
Joey: Diapers, diapers...
Jesse: Diapers...
Joey: (holding up a roll of paper towels) Hey, super absorbent.
Jesse: Bring it over. Okay, now what?
Joey: Okay, spin her.
Jesse: Spin her.
Joey: Spin her.
Jesse: Spin her. All right, now, wrap her up in this, come on. Put her right in here. It's too easy.
Joey: Works for me.
Stephanie: Not bad, but next time try these. (Stephanie holds the diapers)
Jesse: Steph, why did you wait till now to give us the diapers?
Stephanie: Nobody asked me.


Jesse and Joey are in the front room. Danny has just come home from work...
Danny: Hey guys, how'd it go today with - whoa! What happened? What's with all the dirty baby clothes?
The doorbell rings
Joey: I'm sorry, but every time we fed her, she'd drool, or dribble, or spit up.
Jesse: Your baby's a pig.
Jesse opens the door, and Vanessa is sitting in the doorway
Vanessa: Hi, Jesse.
Jesse: Vanessa, have mercy. I thought you were supposed to go to the Philippines with Bob Hope.
Vanessa: Oh, well, I am, but the airport's fogged in. So, is that offer to stay with you any time still good?
Jesse: Oh, it's more than good. It's... uh... amazing!
Stephanie enters
Stephanie: Hi, uncle Jesse. Ready for more ballerina?
Jesse: Uh... we'll play later, okay?
Stephanie: Okay... it's later! Catch me! Ohh!
Jesse: Listen; why don't you go upstairs and play ballerina with your big sister.
Stephanie: I can't. She moved out.
Danny: Stephanie, honey, what do you mean, "She moved out"?
Stephanie: She's gone. She rolled up her crepe paper and took off.
Danny: Okay, everybody follow me.
Danny, Joey, Jesse, and Stephanie are in DJ's bedroom
Danny: You lost my daughter? I went to work for seven hours, and you lost thirty-three percent of my children? Joey, call the police. Jesse, start driving around our neighborhood. I'm gonna call up DJ's friends.
Stephanie: And I'll go get DJ.
Danny: Stephanie, honey.
Stephanie: Yes, daddy?
Danny: Sweetheart, do you know where DJ is?
Stephanie: Uh-huh.
Danny: Why didn't you say something sooner?
Stephanie: Nobody asked me.


Danny, Jesse, and Joey go into the garage, where DJ is on the telephone with Kimmy Gibbler
Danny: DJ, can I talk to you?
DJ: (on the telephone) Kimmy, hang on. (to Danny) I'm talking to Kimmy Gibbler. She called me on her own phone from her own room. She has three sisters.
Danny: DJ, you don't want to live in the garage. It's filthy... it's stuffy...
DJ: You want some fresh air? (DJ opens the garage door)
Danny: (in a firm voice) Donna Jo, I want you back inside right now this instant. (in a milder voice) Is that okay?
DJ: No thank you, dad. (on the telephone) So Kimmy, where were we?
Jesse: (to Danny) Nice job, dad. You've been reading Cosby's book?
Joey: Cosby? I'll handle this. (imitating Bill Cosby, talking to DJ) Hello there, small child- like person. Mmha... ha... ha... If you move back into the house, you can have a big, juicy bowl of jello. Mmha... ha... ha... ha... ha... ha.
DJ: (on the telephone) No, Kimmy, that's not really him. I'll call you later.
Stephanie enters the garage
Stephanie: Daddy, the baby's crying. She's got that thirsty look in her eyes.
Stephanie goes back upstairs again
Danny: Okay, honey. I'll be right up. Joey, would you mind warming up the baby's bottle?
Joey: Well, not at all. Although with this particular baby, it might be simpler just to pour the formula directly into the diaper. Well, think about it.
Joey leaves to warm up the baby's bottle
Jesse: All right, DJ's all set and I got Vanessa upstairs waiting, so best of luck to both of you.
Danny: No, look, Jesse, look; I got to go check on the baby; won't you just stay here with DJ? Talk to her; I'll be right back. Your her uncle - try to be parental, or something. Danny walks upstairs
Jesse: Parental. That's cool. I can be parental. I got parents. (Jesse taps DJ's shoulder)
DJ: Can I help you?
Jesse: Yes. You can move your little bod back in the house. Look, DJ, I don't blame you for wanting your own room. But you got to understand; this world's not a perfect place. Bruce Willis has a record deal. But then a Vanessa shows up at your door, and it all evens out. You know what I'm saying?
DJ: Yeah.
Jesse: Good, so you'll move back in?
DJ: Nah.
Jesse: Nah! All right, I'll speak the language you understand. Five bucks if you'll move back.
DJ: Fifty.
Jesse: Ten.
DJ: Forty-nine.
Jesse: A buck? You went down a buck?
DJ: Okay, it's back up to fifty.
Jesse: All right, my final offer : twenty bucks.
DJ: Twenty-one. Vanessa's waiting...


Danny, Joey, Jesse, and Stephanie are in the front room. Joey is putting his things away in the alcove
Jesse: All right, DJ is moving back in.
Danny: She is? That's fantastic! What did you do?
Jesse: I have a very special way with kids.
Jesse starts to go upstairs
Danny: Uh, Jesse, hang on. Vanessa's not upstairs.
Jesse comes back downstairs
Jesse: Where's Vanessa?
Danny: Well, uh...
Stephanie: She's history.
Jesse covers Stephanie's ears
Jesse: What the hell did you do with Vanessa?
Danny: I didn't do anything with her. I just told her that with three little girls in the house, I thought it would be better is she slept on the couch. And she left.
Jesse: You hate me, don't you.
DJ enters the room
Danny: DJ.
Jesse: Whoa... whoa... whoa... whoa... whoa... whoa... whoa. Vanessa is gone. The deal is off. I want my money back.
Danny: What money?
DJ: The money uncle Jesse paid me to move back in.
Danny: That's your special way with children - you buy them off?
Jesse: It works. Kid, money.
DJ: Fine, I have other sources of income. I'll go back to my new room and have a garage sale.
Danny: DJ, wait. DJ. (to Jesse) Here, take Michelle. (to Stephanie) Come with me, honey.
Jesse: (looking at Michelle) Don't even think about it.


Danny, DJ, and Stephanie are in the kitchen
Danny: DJ, honey, I can't let you have a garage sale.
DJ: What if I give you ten percent of the profits?
Danny: DJ, come here. Can't you just try sharing your room with your sister? Your mom was always so good at this stuff. I'd come home from work, and everything was always perfect. DJ, how would mom have handled this?
DJ: She would have caught me before I moved into the garage. Mom knew everything I did before I did it.
Danny: What is it, honey?
DJ: It's just not fair. First, I lose my mom; then, grandma leaves; now, I even lose my own room? Everything keeps disappearing.
Danny: I know exactly how you feel. And I know how much you girls miss your mother, because I miss her too, very much. But you still got me.
Stephanie: You got me, too.
Danny: You got Michelle, and you have your uncle Jesse, and Joey. DJ, we're still a family, and now is when we really need to stick together. DJ, you and I, we go back a long time - ten years. The ten happiest years of my life. So look; it's up to you. Either you move back inside, or all five of us are moving into the garage. But nothing is gonna break up this team.
DJ: I'll move back in.
Danny: I love you, angel. You too, little ballerina.

Jesse in the front room, talking to Michelle. Joey is in the alcove putting his things away
Jesse: Hey, Michelle. Michelle. Can you say, "Uncle Jesse"?
Michelle: Ah-ah.
Jesse: That's it; you said it. You said, "Uncle Jesse." (Danny, DJ, and Stephanie enter) Starting tomorrow, you use the toilet just like the rest of us.
DJ: Good news. Uncle Jesse, our deal's back on. (Jesse starts to take out money) It's okay; I'll put it on your tab.
Jesse: All right.
Danny: Aw. Is this great, or what? These girls are crazy about you.
Jesse: Oh, sure. I dance around; I give them money.
Michelle: Uh... uh...
Jesse: Now what's the problem?
Danny: Oh, there's no problem. She's singing. Michelle loves music.
Joey: Music? I'll handle this... (Joey starts to sing) Ooh... Flinstones... meet the Flinstones...
Joey & Jesse: (singing) They're a modern stone-age family...
Jesse: Everybody sing along!
Everybody: (singing) From the... town of Bedrock, they're a page right out of history.
Jesse: Let's take a walk.
Everybody: (singing) Let's ride... with the family down the street. Through the... courtesy of Fred's two feet...

Danny: Girls get back over here.You're in just as much trouble as they are.
DJ: Dad,I know we were supposed to...
Jesse: DJ hang on a second.It's not the girls fault. It's mine.I invited the band over,I woke the girls up,I ordered pizza,i was throwing a party and I needed chicks.(We hear Michelle crying)
Joey: Baby alert.Beep.Beep.Baby alert!
Danny: You girls get right into bed.You guys follow me and if that babys hair is purple...(they walk into the kitchen)
In the upstairs hall walking to Michelle's room
Danny: You're irresponsible and your unreliable.(make it to Michelle's room) I'll get back to you.
In Michelle's room
Danny: Oh Michelle,oh honey,it's ok.Daddy is here.I see what this is.Michelle is getting a new tooth. Oh that really hurts.
Jesse: I had nothing to do with it.
Danny: Poor baby,imagine,a sharp pointy,calcified projectile,ripping and knifing it's way through you soft,tender,inflamed gum tissues.
Joey: I say we buy her a pony.
Danny: Sometimes a teething ring helps. (gives Michelle a teething ring) Here Michelle. Here you go. Here honey. She loves it.(Michelle throws it. Joey catches it)
Joey: Is this anything like catching the bouquet? Am I the next one to get married?
Jesse: All right fellows. Let the pro in.I'll show you how it's done.(to Michelle. Put finger in her mouth) All right little Munchkin.Where does it hurt? Oh ya. Give me my finger back.Kid.
Danny: Well your brains not working tonight,but your finger is doing great.Joey do me a favor. I put one of Michelle's teething rings in the freezer. I would like a word alone with the alleged babysitter.
Joey: Jesse,I guess it's a bad time to ask for that girl singer's phone number.
Jesse: Get out of here.(Joey leaves)
Danny: Well,well.
Jesse: What,what.
Danny: Shame,shame.
Jesse: I fell like I'm being chewed out in the Grand Canyon.
Danny: I suppose I should be happy the house is still standing. I must've been crazy to think that you were adult enough to take care of my kids.You really let me down.(starts to walk away)
Jesse: Wait a minute,where are you going?
Danny: Oh,I thought I'd call the Beastie Boys and ask them if they wanna take the girls to the park tomarrow.
Jesse: You love this,don't you?


In Stephanie and DJ's room where Stephanie and DJ talking in the middle of the room
Stephanie: Uncle Jesse's is the best baby sitter we've ever had.
DJ: Yeah,but I'm thinking he's in big trouble. (hears someone coming down the hall) Get in the bed. (she goes in DJ's bed) No your bed! (Danny opens the door)
Danny: Girls are you awake?
DJ: (pretending to be waking up): Dad,is that you?
Stephanie: (doing the same as DJ) Is it morning?
Danny: DJ,Stephanie,come over here right now. (The girls come over to Danny who sits on DJ's bed. DJ stays there but Stephanie sits on Danny's lap) Girls,we have a problem with Uncle Jesse.
DJ: Oh,no,dad.We didn't have any problems with Uncle Jesse at all.
Danny: I'm sorry. He was just so irresponsible. What is this? (Sees all the empty ice-cream boxesand talks sarcastally) Uh-oh?? Empty bowls and empty cartons. Oh,now I see what happened.Uncle Jesse forced ice cream sundays and chocolate milk down your throats.And then he hid the evidence under your table. Oh,the sick fiend.He probably ignored you when you told him no sweets after bedtime,huh?
DJ: Probably.
Danny: No probably about it. Because otherwise you'd be lying. And you know better then that,don't you?
Stephanie: Probably...
Danny: Well that does it.I guess asking Uncle Jesse to move in here was a big mistake. In fact,this may be a matter for the police.Now sweet dreams my perfect little angels.
DJ and Stephanie: Daddy,we were bad.
DJ: We did everything.We even ordered the pizza.We should go and apologize to Uncle Jesse.
Danny: You're right.You go first.
DJ: Are you gonna punish us?
Stephanie: Before you answer that,we saved you a slice of pizza.


In Michelle's room. He still has his finger in Michelle's mouth
Jesse: Good point,Michelle.The thing I wonder is what is life all about anyway.I mean 24 hours ago I was a relatively cool guy. Today, I'm a six foot teething ring.All right bed time.We're going to my bed.Come with me,come on.Let's go. (takes his finger out. Michelle crys and Jesse puts it back in) Ok hang on.I put it back.There you go. Come with me.(Puts Michelle on his back. DJ comes inalong with Stephanie)
DJ: Uncle Jesse.
Jesse: (sternly)Whatever it is the answer is no.
DJ: We just wanted to say thanks for trying to keep us out of trouble.The only reason we took advantage of you is because you had no idea what you were doing.
Stephanie: From now on we will be good and do whatever you say.
DJ: Steph,don't get crazy.(to Jesse)We'll try to do better.
Stephanie: You can cover up my bunnies if you want.
Jesse: That's all right. Your bunnies are starting to grow on me.
Stephanie: We really love you.
Jesse: I love you girls too.(sternly)But next time you pull that stuff on me..(nicely)I'm still gonna love you.(they hug)
Michelle: Daah...(Danny comes in)
Danny: Now you girls go to bed for real,or I'm taking everything out of your room and turning it into a 24 hour mini-mart.
DJ: Good night,everybody.
Stephanie: Good night daddy. Good night Michelle. Good night Uncle Jesse.
Danny: Good night honey.
In Michelle's room where Danny is holding a piece of pizza
Danny: Hi
Jesse: Hi
Danny: Want a piece of pizza?
Jesse: No. me and the little leech are gonna try to get some sleep.(Joey comes in holding a carrot)
Joey: I couldn't find Michelle's teething ring so I got the next best thing. An ice cold carrot.Well I could've bourght the fishsticks but you guys would've thought I was an idiot.
Danny: Look Jesse.I want you to know that was really nice of you to take the rap for DJ and Stephanie. And I'm real sorry,I got so crazy before walking around you saying well...well...well.
Jesse: It's cool...cool...cool.
Danny: The girls just mean so much to me.Exspecially now,you know,snice Pam's gone.
Jesse: I know what your saying,man,I worry about them to. There my neices.Ha..but I don't know nothing about this kid stuff.
Danny: Yeah,I know,but both of you guys,you gotta remember,don't be afraid to say no. Kids need limits.
Jesse: What am I supposed to know? I've been here twelve hours.You're expecting me to be Robert Young.
Joey: Now wait I'm confused. Is it Robert Young from "Father Knows Best",or Robert Young "Dr.Welby?"
Danny: This is gonna take some time.But we can make this work if we want it to work.Jesse,you do want this to work,don't you?
Jesse: Oh,at first I wasn't sure.But,I don't know,when I saw that kid,tell me I could cover her bunnies up,and I was looking at that little baby in my arms,counting on me to stop her from being in pain.I don't know man.I got all warm and tingling...somebody...stop me.
Joey: You know,I'm just happy to be here.I was an only child.All I had was imaginary brothers and sisters.It feels great to be in a real house with real people. Right Leon?
Danny: Give me my kid. (takes Michelle from Jesse.To Michelle) Ok Michelle,time to go to bed.Yeah. Lullaby and good night ,and there's more words I'm not sure of....
Jesse: Conga.(Everyone starts doing the Conga)
Joey: Come on Leon.

Episode 003 * The First Day Of School
No Teaser

DJ and Stephanie are in their room with Kimmy
DJ: So Kimmy, we've got to be the first ones in class tomorrow to get the seats in the back row.
Kimmy: Okay, why?
DJ: Because it's the best place to pass notes.
Kimmy: I love the way your mind works.
Stephanie is sorting through her clothing on her bed.
Stephanie; This outfit is all wrong. Tomorrow's the first day of kindergarten and I have nothing to wear.
DJ: Your bed is full of clothes.
Stephanie: Yeah but they're not me. Well, they're me, but they're the preschool me.
Kimmy: I'll sit anywhere you want, as long as it's not near Arthur Wilcox.
DJ + Kimmy: Arthur Wilcox, ewwwwwwww!
Stephanie: (walks to DJ's bed) Who's Arthur Wilcox?
DJ + Kimmy Ewwwwwwww!
DJ: Stephanie please, Kimmy and I are talking about school.
Stephanie: So am I. What if I walk into class wearing a goofy outfit, and everyone says ‘Stephanie Tanner, ewwwwww!'?
DJ: Would you stop worrying? Kindergarten is so easy. The only thing you have to know is the pledge of allegiance.
Stephanie: What?
DJ + Kimmy: (rise from the bed, speaking very fast) I pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of America, and to the republic for which it stands, one nation under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all.
Stephanie: I'm dead meat.
Jesse and Joey enter, Jesse is holding a very messy Michelle
Jesse: Kimmy, your mom's downstairs.
Joey: She said you were supposed to be home a half an hour ago.
Kimmy: Uh oh, that's the third time today. She's going to kill me.
DJ: Don't panic, just set your watch back one half hour.
Kimmy: I love the way your mind works. (exits the room)
Stephanie: (wearing a blue sweater, jeans, and a brown jacket) Uncle Jesse, how do I look?
Jesse: Like a bag lady.
DJ: What happened to Michelle?
Jesse: Well, your sister Michelle tried to eat her dinner by pushing it through her face.
Joey: Yeah. We'd better give her a bath.
Jesse: That's a good idea Do we know how to do that?
Joey: Sure, it's just like giving a puppy a bath, only there's a little less tail to clean.

Later that night, DJ is asleep. Stephanie shines a flashlight in her face.
Stephanie: DJ, are you asleep?
DJ: I can't tell. I think I'm blind.
Stephanie: Will you look at one more outfit?
DJ: Stephanie, I've seen your entire wardrobe twice.
Stephanie: Okay, want to listen to the pledge. I pledge allegiance to the flag, of some states of America
DJ: (DJ picks up Stephanie and puts her in her own bed) I am going to tuck you in, very tight.
Stephanie: and to the public which understands
with God and liberty I'm dead meat!


Jesse and Joey have finished Michelle's bath.
Jesse: Okay she's clean. You could eat off this baby (puts Michelle in the basinet).
Joey: Hey Jesse, thanks for helping me out with the baby.
Jesse: No problem, I've got a date tonight with a dancer, but not until midnight.
Joey: Another exotic dancer?
Jesse: For your information Joseph, I happen to be dating a ballerina. (Joey stares) Okay, she's a topless ballerina. Good luck tonight.
Joey: Yeah, tonight 9:30. This could be the big break I've been waiting for Jesse. I've been at this comedy stuff since I was 4 years old when I did my first impression. Ever since then all I've wanted to do is make people happy. Does this make any sense to you?
Jesse: Oh yeah, I know what you're saying. You see Joey, you're talking about that magical moment when all of the sudden you know what you want to do with your life. Happened to me when I was six. Turned the TV on, and there was Elvis Pressley, the King Creole. Anyway, Elvis made me feel that music was something special you know. I've got to be honest with you, when he started singing Hardheaded Woman, forget about it, I was touched. It was like, it was like this (stands up in the tub and starts trying to sing and dance like Elvis).
Joey: Jesse, you are great man. You've got all the moves
Jesse: Well, I feel it you know. I feel it, and I'm doing this lip thing, you know, which is new.
Joey: Sing another song. Would you please, for Michelle? She loves music.
Jesse: Alright, I need a scarf. I need (takes a towel off the rack). Here we go. Alright, get a load of this. (singing) Love me tender, love me sweat (throws the towel over Michelle). Never let me go. You have me, and I have you too. And I love you so. Love me tender, love me (Danny enters the room).
Danny: Oh my God!
Jesse: What! We were just giving the kid a bath!
Danny: Then why isn't she in the tub?
Jesse: Because Joey's in the tub, and I'm in the tub, and there's not enough room for, you know all of us!
Danny: It's obvious, I I really am intruding. I'm going to go and put Michelle in her crib (kisses Michelle), I'm going to go check on my other girls, and just leave you two sailors to your suds and your singing. (Danny leaves, Jesse resumes singing)


Danny enters DJ and Stephanie's room
Stephanie: Hi daddy!
DJ: (sleepy) Hi dad.
Danny: (turns on a light) Why is everybody awake?
DJ: I'll show you (flips the covers off of Stephanie's bed).
Stephanie: (wearing a bright pink dress, carrying a lunchbox, rises from bed) I'm ready for school!
Danny: Honey, you're ready for the prom.
Stephanie: You said this would look good.
DJ: Hey, if you can't have fun with your little sister, then what's the point in having one?

Next morning, Danny is in the kitchen, Jesse and Joey enter.
Danny: Good morning boys.
Joey: Mornin' Pa, Hoss.
Jesse: Little Joe.
Danny: How did it go last night?
Joey: Well, I started out great, but right in the middle I
Danny: No. No, I meant in the bathtub with Hoss.
Jesse: Look, I finished Love Me Tender, we did a short medley from Viva Las Vegas, and got the hell out of the tub.
DJ and Stephanie enter the kitchen.
DJ: Dad, we're all ready.
Danny: Girls, I don't want to brag, but Chef Boy-r-dad has made some super great lunches for a super great first day of school. And you know what Stephanie, for you, I've got a brand new lunchbox! (shows Stephanie a ‘Jetsons' lunchbox)
Stephanie: The Jetsons!
Joey takes the lunchbox, imitates the sound of the Jetson jet car as he gives it to Stephanie.
Joey: (imitating George Jetson) Hi, I'm home. Hi Jane, hi Elroy, hi Astro (switches to Astro the dog voice). Hi George, how was your first day of school?
Danny: And DJ, for you, I've got a brand new Barbie lunchbox!
The girls turn to Joey.
Joey: I don't do Barbie.
Jesse: Oh darn.
DJ: Thanks dad, but fifth graders don't carry lunchboxes anymore.
Danny: Try to sell it to a first grader.
DJ: Come on Stephanie, we don't want to miss the bus.
Stephanie: (mumbles) I guess not.
Danny: Wait girls. Stephanie honey, are you sure you don't want me to go with you?
DJ: Don't worry dad, I'll make sure she's okay.
Stephanie: (mumbles) Yeah, it'll be fine.
Danny: You girls are really growing up. Stephanie's starting schoolWait here, I'm going to get my video camera. Don't move.


Danny moves into the living room with his camera.
Danny: You just come in when I tell you to okay, when I say action. Okay, now give me love. Action!
DJ and Stephanie enter the living room, Jesse and Joey enter behind them.
Jesse and Joey: (singing) Is this the little girl I carried? Is this the little girl at play? I don't remember growing older, when did they? (Danny hugs the girls) Sunrise, sunset! Sunrise, sunset, swiftly flow the years. (DJ opens the door, the girls wave as Danny joins the chorus) One season following another, lay down with happiness and tears.
Danny: My little baby is starting school.
Stephanie reenters the living room.
Stephanie: I changed my mind. I'm not going.
Danny: Stephanie honey, what do you mean your not going to school?
Stephanie: (sits on the steps) I don't feel good, maybe I'll go next year.
Jesse: You don't look sick.
Stephanie: (frowns) Is this better?
Joey: (walks up to Stephanie) Well, the face is almost there. Give it kind of a (pushes in her lips) like that, and throw in a real hacking cough (coughs loudly).
Stephanie and Joey trade coughs three times, DJ reenters the house.
DJ: Come on, we're going to miss the bus. (Stephanie coughs) Stephanie, are you okay?
Joey: See, now your tricking people.
Danny: DJ, you go on ahead. Stephanie's a little nervous about her first day of school. I'll make sure she gets there.
DJ: Okay, I'll see you there. (closes the door)
Stephanie moves to the couch.
Danny: Stephanie, where are you going? Stephanie, I want to talk to you. Sweetheart, don't you want to go to school and be smart?
Stephanie: I'll stay home and watch public television.
Jesse: Come on Stephanie, spill your guts. Why don't you want to go to school?
Stephanie: Because I don't know anybody. I will be all alone, it'll be real scary. I won't know anybody, and I won't have any friends.
Danny: Oh. Stephanie, you're going to make friends, I promise. You and I, we're going to go down there together, and daddy's not going to leave until everything's alright.


Danny, Michelle, and Stephanie arrive at Stephanie's school, Stephanie steps inside the class.
Stephanie: Okay, I came to kindergarten! We can go home now! (runs out to the playground).
Danny: Stephanie, wait a minute. Honey, sweetheart don't worry, you're going to feel a lot better after you meet somebody. Oh look, here comes a nice little girl right now.
A blonde haired girl in a black dress runs out of the room, mother pulling on her arm.
Abby: I'M NEVER GOING BACK IN THERE AGAIN! NEVER! NEVER! NEVER! NOOOOOOOOOOO! (breaks free, mother chases her, Stephanie glares at Danny).
Danny: Let's wait for another little girl, one who has a better outlook on life. I know, we'll just we play for awhile and just ease our way into this. Oh look honey, it's a slide, your very favorite! (takes Stephanie and Michelle to the slide)
Stephanie: This is like the lollypop they give you before you get the shot, isn't it?
Danny: Oh no no no no. Why didn't I bring a lollypop? Here, come on honey we're going to play on the slide! Here we go, what fun! Weeeeeeeeee! (Stephanie slides) Oh weeeee! Oh that was fun! Now it's my turn! Here I go, here we go! Weeee! Here I go! (slides) Weeeeeeeeeee! Oh, if we're having this much fun outside the class, just imagine the barrel of monkeys waiting for us inside! (Michelle squeaks) Michelle, oh honey! What's wrong sweetheart?
Stephanie: She's scared too, see what she did?
Danny: Ooooh yeah, she's got a Pamper full of fright. I'm going to go and change her really quick. Sweetheart, I want you to wait inside the class, okay.
Stephanie: Okay, but I don't know anybody in here (walks inside the class).
Jesse: Hey Stephanie, what's shakin'?
Stephanie: Uncle Jesse, what are you doing here?
Jesse: Come here and I'll tell you. (Stephanie walks to Jesse) I was on my way to work, and since I happen to be a part time exterminator, I thought I'd stop by and make sure that there were no pests, bugs, or varmints here in your classroom other than these rug rats. Look, I made this (shows her a green blob)
Stephanie: What is it?
Jesse: It's either a dog with no head or an ash tray.
Stephanie: Dog with no head. Will you stay here and never leave?
Jesse: What's the matter? No pals yet. I don't know why, you look pretty (sniffs) smell okay. Alright, you stay here and get ready to learn some new names. (to the class) ATTENTION ALL MUNCHKINS (rings a bell)! Free milks all around compliments of the coolest kid in class Stephanie Tanner! Make a friend, get a free milk! (the children crowd Stephanie, and soon there is no more milk).
Stephanie: Great, now I have no friends and no milk.
Jesse: I can't believe that milk scam didn't work. Alright, we'll go to my specialty, personal charm. You wait right here, and I'll be back with your new best friend, okay. Sit down (walks to a little girl in a blue sweater and pink hat). Little girl, how would you like to make a new friend?
Becky: Stranger! Stranger! Stranger! (blows a whistle, the teacher runs over to Jesse).
Teacher: Woah, what is going on here?
Jesse: Nothing, I'm just trying to help the kids become friends is all.
Teacher: Who are you?
Jesse: I'm I'm this pretty little girl's father.Right Stephanie?
Stephanie: Uh okay.
Teacher: Well look, as long as you're here, could you come with me into the supply room and kill something with eight legs?
Jesse: I'll be right back. This happens to me all the time. Everybody loves the exterminator. (Jesse leaves)
Joey enters the class
Joey: Hi Stephanie!
Stephanie: Hi
Joey: Wow, this place is great! You've got toys and blocks and Pin the Tail On the Donkey! I sure wish I lived here!
Stephanie: Here, take my place.
Joey: Woah! Okay, there's only sure fire way to make friends, it's Duck Duck Goose time. (to the class) Alright everybody, Stephanie has a great idea! It's Duck Duck Goose time! In a circle that's right! We're ducking, we're goosing, we're having a great time! Alright! Okay, sitting down! Okay! Duck Duck Goose, my favorite! Duck, duck, duck, duck, duck, duck, duck, duck, duck, goose (lands on Stephanie)! You've got to catch me! We're having a great time! (Jesse and the teacher reenter the room).Hello!
Teacher: Okay, everybody go to your chairs! Find your chairs. Who are you?
Joey: I'm I'm this pretty little girl's father.
Stephanie: Uh Okay.
Danny enters the class with Michelle.
Danny: What are you guys doing here?
Teacher: Who are you?
Danny: Oh me, I'm this adorable little girl's father.
Stephanie: Uh huh (the teacher stares).
Jesse: What! Elisabeth Taylor's daughter had seven fathers!
Joey turns to the window.
Joey: Woah Danny! More good news, DJ's going over the wall!
Danny: Oh yeah this dad stuff is a piece of cake. Here, take little poopster (hands Michelle to Joey). Stephanie, stay here.
Stephanie: Okay daddy, daddy, and daddy.
Danny walks out to the playground to see DJ climbing the fence.
Danny: Freeze! What is this? I don't want to jump to conclusions, but it appears what we have here is my daughter ditching school, throwing away her future, and basically becoming a juvenile delinquent.
DJ: In a nutshell yes.
Danny: Do you mind if I asked you a question before you go and knock off a 7-11? Why are you dropping out of school?
DJ: Because they put me in the smart class.
Danny: The advanced class, DJ, that's wonderful!
DJ: Dad, it's Geekville USA. These kids, the first day of school, they brought homework. And get this, I'm the only blonde. Worst of all, they split me and Kimmy up.
Danny: Oh. I know you're disappointed.
DJ: Dad you don't understand. Kimmy and I have always been in the same class. Now I'm in a room full of eggheads. They're worse then eggheads, they're omletteheads.
Danny: DJ, it's the omletteheads that rule the world. You really should give this a chance. You know why?
DJ: Why?
Danny: Because if you don't try new things, you'll never know what you're missing out on.
Stephanie: (to the class) Bye! (heads down the sidewalk) Bye dad.
Danny: Hold it! Where do you think you're going?
Stephanie: Home.
Danny: You're not going anywhere! Nobody is going any place unless it's back into those two rooms!
Jesse and Joey leave the class.
Jesse: There she is.
Danny: I got this. (they back off) What you two need to understand is (DJ motions to Danny) Yes. (DJ and Danny move away from Stephanie) Stay.
DJ: Let me just talk to my sister alone okay, woman to woman. I think I can help.
Danny: Okay. (Danny leaves)
DJ: Stephanie, what's wrong?
Stephanie goes over to the slide and takes a seat.
Stephanie: No friends.
DJ: You can't expect to make friends the first day. You know when I started kindergarten I didn't know anybody either.
Stephanie: What about Kimmy?
DJ: We were just in the same class, but I didn't talk to Kimmy for six months.
Stephanie: Because she's an airhead.
DJ: She's not an airhead, she just hates thinking. That's probably why we're not in the same class anymore. I just got stuck in a room full of omletteheads where I don't know one person. It's pretty scary.
Stephanie: Real scary.
DJ: But Stephanie, you can't run away every time you're scared. If you don't try knew things, you'll never know what you're missing out on. (stops) Where did I hear that? Oh no, he was right!
Stephanie: Who was right?
DJ: You don't know him. Anyway, making friends takes time, but you've got one new friend in school already.
Stephanie: Who?
DJ: Me, and I'm right down the hall, room 6. You can't miss me, I'm the only omlettehead with blonde hair.
Stephanie: Thanks (they hug).
DJ: Stephanie, I will go back to my class if you go back to yours okay?
Stephanie: Okay.
They split up, Stephanie enters the class, Joey, Jesse, and Danny are inside sipping on milk cartons, we leave with her class singing Itsy Bitsy Spider.

Episode 004 * The Return Of Grandma
No Teaser

DJ: Let's watch MTV.
Stephanie: No, let's watch Bugs Bunny.
Joey: But, Steph, Bugs Bunny is kids' stuff. We've got to watch Yogi Bear.
Stephanie: But I like Bugs Bunny.
Joey: Yeah, but Steph every episode is the same. First Elmer Fudd says (
imitating Elmer Fudd) "Why you pesky wabbit" then he takes a shot at Bugs. Then Yosemite Sam comes in (
imitating Yosemite Sam) "Ooh, I hate that rabbit" Then he takes a shot at Bugs. I mean, with all this shooting going on I don't know why Bugs ever pops his head out of that hole. Let's face it - the rabbit has a death wish.
Stephanie: Better than watching Yogi steal the same picnic basket. Boring.

Danny comes downstairs in a dressing gown
Danny: Good morning kids.
Joey + Stephanie + DJ: Hi dad!
Danny: I don't really see you eating cereal out of pots with wooden implements, do I?
DJ: Yes. You do.
Danny: Great. after breakfast why don't we take this laundry down to the bay and beat it against some rocks? Joey, could you come with me right now into the kitchen please?
Joey: What, now? I'll miss the start of Yogi!
Danny: It's not Agatha Christie - you'll catch up.
Joey:
( following Danny into the kitchen) Girls, take accurate notes!


Danny and Joey walk into the kitchen. The dishwasher is crammed with dirty dishes.
Danny: Whoa! It's Howdy-dirty! Joey, the deal we made was this is your week to take care of the dishes.
Joey: I'm just waiting till the dishwasher's full.
(he puts a dirty spoon in the dishwasher) There, now we won't be wastingwater.
Danny: Of course we won't. There's no room for water.
Jesse comes up from the basement.
Jesse: Boy, what a night!
Danny: Jess, what the heck's going on here? You told me you were going to take care of the laundry.
Jesse: I did, I did mine.
Danny: What about everybody else's laundry?
Jesse: Looks to me like they haven't touched it. The lazy bums! Fellows, let me tell you about this story. Last night my band was playing this gig in Chinatown, a sweet and sour sixteen party if you will. Anyway, I'm cruising home on my Harley, I come to a red light, I stop.
Danny: Great story.
Joey: Yeah, you told it great.
Jesse: Fellows, I'm building, I'm building. Anyway, the light turns green, right? I try to move. I cant - there's something wedged under my tyre. Just then, this runaway street-cleaner comes barreling through the intersect right where I would have been. I came this close to being a really clean dead guy. Fellows, I'd like to introduce to you the little dude that saved my life...(
he takes a live turtle out of his bag)... Bubba! I love this amphibian!
Danny: You just hate coming home alone, don't you?
Jesse: I've got to go get my guitar. Here, hold Bubba (
he gives him to Danny) Keep him happy. It just may save your life.
Jesse runs downstairs to the basement.
DJ : (
calling from the living room) Joey, whereare you?
Danny: (
to Joey) Don't let the girls see him, they're going to want to keep him.
Joey: Hide him. Hide him.
Danny: Where?
Joey: The pot. The pot. Under the pot.
Danny: Good idea.
(they put Bubba under a pot on the kitchen counter.)
Joey: OK, I don't see a turtle.
Danny: Act casual.
Joey: Oh, yeah. Nonchalant.
Danny: good word - nonchalant.
DJ and Stephanie walk into the kitchen.
DJ: Joey, Yogi may be much smarter than the average bear but he's much dumber than the average three-year-old.
The pot on the counter moves a few inches.
Stephanie: What's that?
Danny: That? Oh, it's dinner. Roast beef. Yeah, roast beef.
The pot moves some more.
DJ: and where is our roast beef going?
Joey: It's going to the oven.
DJ lifts the pot. Jesse comes upstairs from the basement.
Stephanie: Roast beef comes from turtles?
Jesse: Not my turtle, it doesn't. I love this amphibian.
Stephanie: I love him, too. Can we keep him?
Jesse: Of course we can keep him. Bubba's a hero!
DJ: Uncle Jesse, we'll take care of him for you.
Jesse: All right.
Danny: Are you sure, honey? It's a big responsibility.
DJ: No problem.
Jesse: (
staring Bubba in the face) Let's go get Bubba settled. He looks a little pasty.
Jesse and DJ run upstairs.
Stephanie: what a great day, we get a turtle and Grandma's coming to visit.
Danny: Stephanie. Sweetheart, honey, baby. Did you just say Grandma's coming?
Stephanie: That's what she said on the phone.
Danny: Well, why didn't you say something?
Stephanie: Nobody asked me.
Danny: Steph, it's not possible for me to ask you every question. Do you know how many questions there are in the world?
Stephanie: (
thinking for a second) eight!
Danny: what time is Grandma coming, honey?
Joey: The plane gets in at 5:12, Sugar-hips!
Danny: Sweetheart, go upstairs and play with Bubba.(
to Joey) Joey, how did you know about my mother?
Joey: I answered the phone when she called.
Danny: Well, why didn't you say something?
Joey: Nobody asked me.
Jesse comes downstairs.
Jesse: I found a home for Bubba. It's calm, cool, comfortable. Nobody flush, OK? I'll shred him lunch, and swat him dessert (
he holds up a fly-swatter)
Danny: Jesse, forget about the turtle. My mum's on her way.
Jesse: She's coming back already? She just moved out ofhere!
Danny: I know that, but she's coming to check up on me. She doesn't think I can handle things.
Jesse: What? The place looks great!
Danny: You don't understand - all my life I've had someone to take care of me. First it was my mum, then I got married it was Pam, for the first time I want to prove to my mum and myself that I can take care of my family on my own, by myself. Just me. That's why I desperately need your help.
Jesse: What do you want us to do?
Joey: Yeah.
Danny: Jesse, take another shot at the laundry.
Jesse: All right.
Danny: Joey, see if you can wedge some cleaning detergent into the dishwasher. I'm going to mop the floor.
Jesse: Bad news, Danno. We're out of detergent.
Joey: We're ditto on the dish soap.
Danny: And we're out of floor wax. Let's go shopping.
Jesse: Whoa! You're in your pyjamas!
Danny: Oh, I know. I just woke up. (
He suddenly realises what Jesse meant) Oh! I get it! I've got to go put some clothes on. Gee, I wish you could wear pyjamas at the market. (
he runs upstairs.
Joey: He may need his mother.


Soon, in the living room...
Danny: DJ, let's go. Stephanie, hurry up. Grandma's going to be in tee minus seven hours in counting.
Joey: Can't we wait till Yogi's over?
Danny: Tape it.
Joey: Of course I'm going to tape it, I tape all of them. It's just that Yogi is so much better live.
Jesse: (
coming in from the kitchen) All right, we need Turtle Chow, Leaf-eat-Green, there's no such thing as Fly-helper, is there?
DJ: (
coming downstairs) I got baby diapers, baby wipes, extra baby clothes and the baby's backpack.
Danny: Great.
Stephanie: Here's baby apple juice and baby biter biscuits.
Danny: Wonderful.
Jesse: Hey, the baby loves music, think we should bring along the organ?
Danny: I got it covered. I'm bringing her crib-blaster. OK, troops. Move out!
Stephanie: don't forget Mr. Pandy.
Danny: Oh, that's right, honey, Michelle won't go anywhere without Mr. Pandy. Let's go. Everybody move it. (
Danny closes the door then comes back in again and picks up Michelle) I am so sorry. You won't remember this, will you? (
He closes the door again, then opens it again.) How many times do I have to tell you - make a tinkle before you leave the house!

Joey comes running in.

Later, in the kitchen, the guys are passing boxes up from the basement.
Danny : Coming up.
Joey : Coming up
Jesse : It's up.
Danny: (
passing Michelle to Joey) Coming up.
Joey: Coming up.
Jesse: Don't we have one of these?
DJ: I'll take Michelle.
Stephanie: (
dragging Mr. Pandy) I hate this thing!
Danny: Only five hours till my mum shows up. Here's the plan. I'll do the kitchen. Joey, you do the living room. Jesse you take the bedrooms. Now, who's going to do the toilets.
Joey + Jesse: Oh, girls!

In the living room, Michelle is riding on Bubba'sback.
Stephanie: Giddy up, Bubba. Giddy up. Come on.
The guys walk in.
Joey: Can I go next?
Danny: DJ, go put Annie Oakly in her bunkhouse.
DJ takes Michelle upstairs.
Danny: Jesse, find a corral for Trigger.


Jesse puts Bubba in Michelle's cot.
Danny: Joey, I'm all out of cowboy metaphors, so let's just put away the grub. I was wrong, I had one left.
Joey: Danny, we've been shopping all morning, can't we have a little Yogi break?
Jesse : Yeah, sit down with your family. Relax. Watch the bear.
Danny: All right, All right, but we're just going to watch until Yogi gets a picnic basket. OK, he's got one.
Claire walks in.
Claire: Hi.
DJ + Stephanie: Grandma!
Danny: Oh, my god.
Claire walks up to Michelle's cot and looks inside.
Claire: Oh, my god, my granddaughter is a turtle!
Joey: (
lifting up Bubba) Michelle needs your love now more than ever.
Jesse: Give me that! (
to Claire) This turtle saved my life. Bubba, Claire, Claire, Bubba. I love this amphibian!
Stephanie: Isn't he cool?
DJ: Pat his head, Grandma, he really likes that.
Claire: Oh, he's a reptile!
Jesse: Hey, back off. He's been nothing but nice to you!
Danny: Mum, what are you doing here so early? Joey said you'll be here at 5:12.
Claire: Try 12:05.
Joey: Guess you had to find out sooner or later. My name is Joey, and I'm a time dyslectic. I would have told you earlier, but I'm justnot sure when earlier is.
Claire: Girls, will you just go upstairs and clean your room?
Stephanie: How did she know our room was a mess?
DJ: Grandma vision.
Danny: Mum, don't worry, we're on the verge of a major clean, aren't we boys?
Jesse: Well, we were but now what's the point? I mean, no one cleans the house better than your mum, right Joseph?
Joey: Oh, you're awesome, Mrs. Tanner.
Jesse: So why don't we just get out of your way, and Claire, go nuts!
Joey: Absolutely. We'll just catch a movie or something, and Mrs. Tanner, if you happen to finish up before we get back, I'd just like to leave you with these two words - lamb chops.
They leave.
Danny: Don't listen to them mum, you can cook anything you want.


Later, Jesse and Joey come back.
Joey: Honey, we're home.
Danny: Boys, we've got some trouble.
Jesse: I'll say we've got trouble. Look at this place! It's a pigsty! I think you're mum's lost her touch.
Danny: She doesn't want to clean up our mess. She wants us to do it.
Joey: She wants us to do it?
Jesse: What's the matter? Can't you handle your mum? You wimp! You're a total mummy wimp!
Danny: Oh, and I suppose you handle your mum differently?
Jesse: I play my mum like a piano. Yeah.
Claire comes in from the kitchen.
Claire: Well, I'm glad you're back. Come on in!
Two women walk in.
Jesse: Your mum called our mums?
Irene: Hello Jesse.
Mindy: Hi, Joey.
Jesse + Joey: Hi mum.
Claire: Yes, I thought that Irene and Mindy would be very interested to see how you boys keep house.
Danny: (
to Jesse) OK, Piano-man. Why don't you show the wimp how to tickle those ivories.
Jesse(
sternly) Ma?
Irene: (
sternly) Jesse?
Jesse: can I make you some tea?
Danny: Oh, bravo, bravo.
Jesse: Guys!
Irene: No tea, thank you. Oh, tuck in your shirt!
Jesse: Ma!
Irene: Oh, Jesse, I remember when you were eight years old.
Jesse: Oh, Ma, please don't tell that story.
Danny: No, tell. Tell. We love stories.
Irene: I'll never forget it. My little Jesse tugged on my apron and said," Mummy, can I please help you iron?" I said "sure finish the sleeves." It must have been like when Babe Ruth picked up his first bat. To this day, he's the only one I'll trust with my shefan blouses.
Joey: To iron or wear?
Jesse: Hey, man! To iron!
Claire: All right, enough of this talking. now you boys have a lot of work to do so where's the vacuum cleaner?
Joey: Vacuum clean? We'll handle this. Mum, let's show them the hoover.
Mindy: Great.
Joey lies on some roller skates making hoover sounds while Mindy hold his legs.
Claire: Mindy?
Mindy: Of course. Joey, there is a time to have fun and a time to be serious.
Claire: Listen, girls, I think one of us should be here at all time to se that things go properly, after all this is where our grandchildren live.
Irene: You are so right. I can be here Monday through Wednsday.
Mindy: Well, I'm free Thursday and Friday.
Claire: And I can fly in on the weekends, so it's all settled.
Danny: Boys, we are staring into the jaws of a never ending living hell.
Mums: What?
Danny (
to the mums) no offence.
Joey: Mums, I don't blame you for treating us like children, because sometimes that's how we act.
Jesse: Yeah, listen, girls. When we first moved in here we knew we had some responsibilities to do, but we haven't really fallen through yet, but from now on we're really going to buckle down.
Danny: Mothers, I have a propsition for you. You all go shopping for a couple of hours, and if this place isn't clean by the time you get back, you can all move in and just rule our lives forever. Deal?
Mothers: Deal!


The guys are at the top of the starirs in front of the bathroom.
Danny: OK, there's the bathroom.
Jesse: Yep, there's the bathroom.
Joey: Same place it was last time we didn't clean it.
They all stare inside.
Danny: Here's a thought, why don't we see if the girls have finished cleaning their room.
Jesse: Loving it. Loving it.
They walk into the girls' room. The room is a mess.
Danny: What happened?
Joey: There's been a bedroom tornado.
Stephanie: We lost something.
Danny: Might that be your minds?
DJ: We lost (
muffling the last word with her hand)mmmph.
Jesse: What exactly is mmmph?
Stephanie: Mmmph is what you say when you don't want to say "Bubba".
Jesse: You lost Bubba?!
Joey: He loves that amphibian.
DJ: We're really sorry. We turned our backs for one minute and he was gone!
Danny: It's OK, girls, I'm sure Bubba is somewhere in the house.
Jesse: All right, guys, we're going to turn this house upside down until we find that turtle. Ready? Go!
Everyone: Bubba! Bubba!

Later in the living room (which is a total mess)
Stephanie: No Bubba?
Jesse: No Bubba.
DJ: Uncle Jesse, me and Steph will buy you another turtle.
Stephanie: You can have all my money - two dollars and fifty eight cents.
The three mums walk in.
Irene: My advice is don't clean any more, just move.
Danny: We'll be right with you, we're having a little family problem here.
Stephanie: We'll look for Bubba for the rest of our lives.
Jesse: That's all right. Bubba's work here was done. I'm sure he's out in the world saving other lives.
DJ: You mean you're really not mad at us?
Joey: You didn't think we'd get mad over a stinky turtle.
Jesse: Hey, if you had four armpits and you were an inch off the ground, how would you smell?
Danny: Girls. Girls, I know you feel bad. But that's because you love your Uncle Jesse and you feel like you let him down. I know that losing Bubba was an accident.You've got to understand we're right behind you no matter what you do.
Joey: And if you ever have a problem, we'll be there for you.
Jesse: That's right, and if we ever have a problem, we know you guys are going to be there for us, right? (
DJ and Stephanie nod) All right. Come here you little munchkins. Give us a hug.
They hug Jesse and Joey.
Danny: Next.
The girls hug Danny.
Irene: That is so sweet.
Jesse: All right, enough of this warmth joke.
Claire: Oh, we're going to have a great time living here, right girls?
Mindy: Oh yes. We are.
Danny: Just a minute ladies. We would like another shot at this please.
Joey: Why don't you the girls to the zoo for three hours.
DJ: Yeah!
Stephanie: Yeah!
Jesse: We've got some work to do all right?


Soon, the guys start cleaning while dancing to a song, and finish off by doing the splits.
Joey: I split my pants.
Danny: I can't stand my pants. All right, guys. We made it with five seconds to spare. Everybody up. Let's go. 5.....
Jesse: We're done.
Danny: 4...
Joey: We're cool.
Danny: 3....
Jesse: We're calm.
Danny: 2.....1....
The mothers and the girls walk in.
Claire: We completely lost track of the time.
Irene: Oh, it's immacutale.
Stephanie: Grandma Irene, does this mean hell is freezing over?
Danny: Go on. Find a speck of dirt. I double-dare you.
Mums: OK,
The girls put their suveniers from the zoo on thefront step.
Guys: Hey! Whoa! Whoa!
Jesse: Take Granmda's goodies upstairs, and put them in the toybox right now!
DJ: Whoa! And he used to be the easy one!
Irene, Mindy and Claire walk towards the kitcken.
Joey: Hold it! Hold it! You are about to enter a sterile environment.
He hoovers each one as they walk into the kitchen
Jesse: Don't even think about it! (
in the kitchen) Ma, what about those creases, huh?
Irene: Oh, Jesse, you still have your touch!
Danny: (
to Claire) Perfet. Everything is just perfect.
Joey: Look, mum, you could eat off these dishes.
Claire: Congratulations I am really proud of all of you.
A woman walks in.
Mrs. Sinski: Sorry. Banks' closed. Can you pay in cash.
Joey: Uh, Mum, I'd like you to meet my fiance, Jennifer.
Mindy: Are you going to give me a grandchild?
Mrs. Sinski: Not for this kind of money.
Danny: Here you go Mrs. Sinski. Thanks for everything. See you you next weekend.
The mums nod unapprovingly.
Danny: OK, so we had a little help.
Jesse: Well, just with the hard stuff and the toilets.
Joey: But we make a great team.
Danny: From now on things are going to go a lot smoother around here.
Claire: I'm sure they will. Does that mean you won't need us anymore?
The mothers give "the lip".
Joey: Oo, they're good.
Jesse: Of course we still need you. You girls come by and visit anytime.
Claire: OK, listen. I have to admit, I was a bit worried how you boys were managing the girls, but, well, you may be a little sloppy but those kids are getting a lot of love.
Danny: Thanks Mum.
Joey, Jesse and Danny hug their mums. DJ comes downstairs.
DJ: Aw, this is nice. I wish Bubba was here to sharethis.
Bubba comes in through the back door on a skateboard.
DJ: Bubba!
Stephanie : I found him. I love that amphibian!

Episode 005 * Sea Cruise
No Teaser

Jesse is playing the guitar in the living room, trying to work out song lyrics.
Jesse: She's driving a... She's driving... She's driving, okay... She's driving a... She's drive... Drive... Dri... No she's... She's driving... Driving... She's dri... Maybe she's walking.
Joey enters from the kitchen.
Joey: Jesse, You've got to see this.
Jesse: Not now, I'm working on this tune about this outrageous Italian goddess who drives a Lamborghini. What rhymes with Lamborghini?
Joey: How about Cecil and beanie?
Jesse: How about, you're a weenie?
Danny enters from the kitchen with his video camera.
Danny: Jesse, check out this serious toddling! (Michelle enters walking from the kitchen) Tracking shot! Tracking shot! Come on, Michelle!
Jesse: Danny, the kid has been walking for three days and you haven't stopped taping her. I'll feel sorry for her when she starts potty training. (Michelle heads for the kitchen, Joey picks her up)
Danny: Do you realize what this means? My sweet little Michelle, she's now an object grabbing, heat seeking instrument of destruction.
Joey: (with Michelle, munchkin voice) Hear this humans, I am robo-baby!
DJ and Stephanie enter from upstairs, wearing their Honeybee uniforms.
DJ: Is grandma here?
Danny: Not yet. Oh look how cute you two look!
Jesse: Cute. Just what we need, more cute.
Stephanie: Grandma better get here soon. We're very bizzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzy with honeybee bizzzzzzzzzzzzzzzness.
Danny: Joey, keep taping. Girls get up on the steps. I want to ask you some things. (the girls head for the front steps). So DJ, how does it feel to be retiring as queen bee?
DJ: Great, I am way to old for this outfit. It's time to pass my antenna on to the bees of the future (places the antenna hat on Stephanie).
Stephanie: I beeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee so happy.
Danny: Girls, do the secret honeybee hello.
DJ: Okay, but I cannot allow this on tape (Joey shuts off the video camera). (tap dance around each other and rub elbows) Bizzzzzzzip, (tap dance back and rub elbows again) bizzzzzzzzzzzzip, (meet in the middle and bump hips) bizzzzzzzzah! A car honks.
Stephanie: That's grandma. We've got to buzzzzzzzzz off.
Danny: Okay, come here Michelle (kisses Michelle as he picks her up). Here's the baby's bag (hands a blue bag to Stephanie), and oh yeah, here's the baby (hands Michelle to DJ). There you go.
DJ + Stephanie: Bye!
Stephanie: Bye! See you later boys! (DJ and Stephanie leave, Danny closes the door).
Danny: Guys, there's no children in the house. Do you hear what I hear?
Jesse: I don't hear anything.
Danny: Exactly (walks behind them). It's silence.
Jesse: Oh!
Joey: Well... (Jesse and Danny cover Joey's mouth0.
Danny: I can't believe this. I have no parental responsibilities. This is great. No, that's not true. I really miss my kids. No, that's not true. This is great!
Jesse: Alright, let's party boys! I have an idea. Let's get some girls.
Joey: Great. There's a Three Stooges festival down town. You can meet some fun girls there, and the great part is they don't mind if you poke them in the eye.
Danny: I don't know about this.
Jesse: No no no. I've got a better idea. I get on my Harley, you guys follow behind me in the country squire, not to close. We'll cruise up to Tahoe, Heirs is having a Marilyn Monroe look alike night.
Danny: How do you know about this?
Jesse: How do you not know about this?
Danny: Guys, we've never had a boy's night out, just the three of us. Let's go out together and just do some male bonding.
Jesse: Male bonding? Joey, do you want to bond?
Joey: All I want is a woman who at just the right moment goes (Three Stooges voice) Woowoowoowoowoowoo Neeyah!
Danny: Guys time out, I can't do this. It's only been 5 months since I lost Pam. Hey, don't let me stand in your way. I'll be fine, I'll just stay home alone, maybe change the part in my hair. You guys, go out, have a great time.
Jesse + Joey: Never mind.
Joey: Okay, we're available for bonding.
Jesse: We'll do whatever you want. I promise.
Danny: Great. You are not even going to think about women when you see what I've got in store for you.

Later on that night in the living room, Danny and Joey are in fishing gear.
Danny: Let's go fishing! Neptune's Bride sails at midnight!
Joey: Great. I've been dying for a place to wear this outfit.
Jesse: (enters from up stairs) Alright, let's get this wonderful, fun filled, magical night of bonding over with.
Danny: Jesse, we're going fishing. You look ridiculous.
Jesse: (turns and looks at Joey's clothes) I look ridiculous.
Phone rings, Joey answers.
Joey: (drops his voice) Gilligan's living room. (back to regular voice) No wait, don't hang up. Sorry, I'm not supposed to answer the phone. Yes, Jesse's here. Who may I say who's calling?
Jesse: Give me the phone!
Joey: No! Get out of town! The Roxanna, the rock star Roxanna!
Jesse: Come on!
Joey: (to Jesse) Jesse, how do you know Roxanna?
Jesse: Alright, we had this hot and heavy thing for awhile. Actually it was kind of serious, we dated, then she became a big star and went on the road, so we drifted apart... Give me the phone!
Joey: (to the phone) Is this true? (to Jesse) You're story checks out. So Roxanna, heard your new album.
Jesse: Joseph, you leave me no choice.
Joey: uh huh. Uh... (Jesse walks behind Joey with other end of the phone, and chokes him with the phone cord).
Jesse: Say good-bye.
Joey: Good-bye.
Jesse: (to the phone) Hello. Oh sorry, that was Joey. He was raised by a family of really stupid wolves. How are you doing?... I'm doing great. Yeah. ... My music? Oh, my music is going really well. Yeah
Joey: That's great! You told me you couldn't even find a job!
Jesse: (to Joey) Beat it wolf boy! (to the phone) You know, it... it would be nice to see you again. ... Tonight, yeah. Tonight would be good.
Danny: Jesse you promised. (Joey starts doing an impression of a fishing reel)
Jesse: But actually, I can't tonight. ... No, I'm going fishi... I'm going boat... I'm going yachting actually. Yeah, I'm going yachting on a boat. Yeah. Well, we're having a big party, Neptune's Bride. Yeah. Champaign, caviar, what have you. ... Alright good, I'll call you in the morning. Bye (hangs up the phone)
Danny: Thanks Jesse. You're not going to regret this.
Jesse: Oh, why would I want to hang out with a big, beautiful rock star, when I can spend an evening with Thurston Hall III (points to Joey) and Mr. Paul, the human fish stick (points to Danny)?


Later at the peer
Danny: Ahoy mates. There she be, Neptune's Bride. The finest lady to sail the seven seas.
Joey: (pirate voice) Argh, I say we mount 'er.
Jesse: That's 'board 'er' squid head.
Danny: Isn't this great. A night of men doing manly things (places his tackle box on the ground). You know, there isn't a manlier man among men then the old salty dog who pilots this vessel. Old Captain Jack! Where you be?
A dark haired woman in a pink shirt and jeans come around the corner.
Caroline: He be retired. I'm his granddaughter, Caroline. I'll be your captain this evening (she leaves).
Jesse: Oh yeah. Men don't come any manlier.
Danny: Okay, so except for Old Captain Caroline, it's boy's night out. Manly men doing masculine things.
Roxanna comes up behind them with a blonde girl in a gold dress and another in a white dress.
Roxanne: Jesse!
Jesse: Roxanna! Have Mercy! Come here! (they hug) What are you doing here?
Roxanne: I tracked you down. I'm going on tour tomorrow and I just had to see you. These are my back up singers.
Yvonne: I'm Yvonne
Vega: I'm Vega.
Joey: I'm happy.
Roxanne: Jesse, this isn't a yacht.
Jesse: Oh yeah, you're telling me. That's the last time I rent a yacht from a guy named Icepick.
Yvonne: So what? There's not a party?
Danny: We're here to fish! There's no party.
Joey: There is now!
Jesse: Yeah! (they begin to board the boat) Alright, that's Joey and Danny. Which one's Ivon, and which one's Vega?


Later on the boat.
Jesse: Look at that, a full moon.
Roxanne: There was a full moon the last night we were together. Remember Big Sur.
Jesse: I remember we rented the cabin and went crazy in every little room.
Roxanne: Yeah. Then we went down to the beach and we got even crazier.
Jesse: Remember the seals were clapping for us. That's ancient history, right?
Roxanne: Yeah, it's all in the past.
Jesse: Just a shooting star that burns itself out.
Roxanne: Nothing but memories (they kiss).
Jesse: Yeah, the magic's gone. (they kiss again)
Joey and Danny walk up behind them.
Joey + Danny: (singing) Love, exciting and new. Come aboard, we're expecting you.
Jesse: You guys just butchered a classic.
Caroline: (to Danny) Well, we're in a great spot here.
Danny: Oh yeah, I'm psyched. I've got my lucky pole, my lucky hat, my lucky underwear with the little sharks on it. But I digress.
Caroline: You're kind of funny.
Danny: No.
Caroline: Yeah.
Danny: No.
Caroline: Yeah.
Danny: Okay yeah. Alright Joey, it's time for a fishing lesson from the master.
Joey: Alright Danny, show me how it's done.
Danny: The art of casting. Flip back your winder, keep your thumb on the line, cast forward with a firm flowing motion, release your thumb, and let 'er go (casts into the water).
Joey: I've got it. Flip back your winder, keep your thumb on the line, cast forward with a firm flowing motion, release your thumb and let 'er go (attempts to cast, but looses his fishing pole as it goes overboard).


Later on that night
Jesse: (reels in a fish) Whoa, we got another one. That makes four.
Danny: I can't believe I haven't caught a thing.
Yvonne: (reels in a fish) This makes five for us
Vega: Alright!
Danny: How can this be, look what they're wearing? (pulls his hook out of the water) Oh great, my bate is yawning. Wake up! Wake up!
Jesse: This is so boring, reeling in fish after fish after fish (waves another fish in front of Danny).
Danny: Will you shut up?
Roxanne: (to Jesse) You know, I wish we could see each other more often.
Jesse: I know. The only time I see you now is on MTV.
Roxanne: I owe a lot of my success to you.
Jesse: No Roxanna, you made it because you are good. Remember the first song that you sang with my band.
Roxanne: Oh yeah.
Jesse: And the dance?
Roxanne: How could I forget?
Jesse: Do it.
Roxanne: (singing) He rocks in the treetop all day long, hoppin' and boppin' and singin' his song.
Jesse + Roxanne: All the little birds on Jay Bird Street, love to hear the robin goin' tweet tweet tweet
Roxanne: Rockin' Robin
Yvonne + Vega: Tweet, tweet, tweet.
Jesse: Look at this!
Roxanne: Rockin' Robin
Jesse: Fellas?
Joey + Danny: Tweet, twittley-deet
Jesse + Roxanne: Blow rockin' robin, cause we're really gonna rock tonight!
Jesse: This is good! Alright, let's do some choreography!
The girls side step in front of the men.
Women: Every little swallow, every chickadee,
Danny: Every little bird in the tall oak tree (the men throw one of their shoes overboard).
Roxanne: (the girls move back to the right of the men) The wise old owl
Jesse + Roxanne: The big black crow, flappin' their wings singin'
Danny + Joey: 'Go bird, go'
Roxanne: Rockin' robin
Women: Tweet, tweet, tweet.
Men: Rockin' robin. Tweet, twittly-deet
Women: Blow rockin' robin, 'cause we're really gonna rock tonight.
Men: Tweet
All: Twittly-deet.
Jesse: Yeah!
Danny: Oh man! Wow, that was almost fun (returns to his fishing pole, feels something pulling on his hook). Whoa! Whoa! Wo...WHOA! (Danny goes overboard).
Joey: (removes his hat) I'm coming beanie boy! (Jumps in the water, Jesse hesitates)
Jesse: Hold on (removes his leather vest, jumps in the water).


The next day, everyone from the night before is at the Tanner house having breakfast.
Joey: Anybody else want some of my halibut? (to Danny) My albacore? My swordfish? ...
Danny: Shut up!
Jesse: You're just cranky because you got pulled overboard by a Mischalin Radial.
Danny: Hey, that tire had an incredible will to live.
Yvonne: Hey Roxanna, we'll meet you back at the hotel
Vega: Yeah, thanks for breakfast guys (Joey, Jesse, Vega, Ivon, and Roxanna exit to the living room)..
Yvonne: (to Joey) Oh, and thanks for the Pepto Bismol.
Joey: I know my antacids.
Vega: You know Joey, being with you actually bordered on fun.
Joey: Yeah, I hear that a lot.
Jesse: Seems like we're always saying good bye huh?
Roxanne: I hate it. Jesse, come on the road with me.
Jesse: And join the band?
Roxanne: Well no, we're an all girl group, and you are definitely not a girl.
Jesse: Then why would I go on the road with you?
Roxanne: Just to be with me.
Jesse: And do what, carry your bags for you? Tune your guitar? Is that what you want?
Roxanne: No. Jesse, it's not like that at all...
Jesse: What? Do you think that I've got nothing better to do then follow you around like... like a little puppy dog or something?
Roxanne: No.
Joey enters the kitchen to see Danny and Caroline at the counter.
Caroline: You know, I really had a great time.
Danny: So did I.
Caroline: How about I make you dinner?
Danny: (nervous) Dinner?
Caroline: You know, the food you eat when it gets dark.
Danny: No dinner.
Caroline: How about lunch?
Danny: No. No lunch, no food.
Caroline: Liquid protein?
Danny: Look Caroline, I'm really sorry, but I think this whole thing was just kind of a big mistake. You... you really shouldn't be here right now, because you really should be somewhere else. Let me walk you to the door, okay.
Back to the living room.
Roxanne: Jesse, you're overreacting!
Jesse: No, I'm not! I'm not overreacting! Come on, let's go! This is not going to work out!
Roxanne: Jesse, please! I...
Jesse: Go, be a big star, get in your limousine! It's alright!
Joey: Everybody Freeze! I need to see Jesse and Danny in the kitchen right now!
Jesse: Joey, I'm in the middle of something!
Joey: Humor me. Girls, look, please don't leave. Caroline you like fish, Roxanna you like music, talk about Muddy Waters.
The men enter the kitchen.
Jesse: Joey, what is your problem?
Joey: You guys are crazy! (to Danny) You had a nice time with Caroline. (to Jesse) You had a nice time with Roxanna. What's the story here?
Danny: Caroline and I are none of your business.
Jesse: Right, neither are Roxanna and I. Thanks Joey (starts to leave).
Joey: Jesse, your attitude wouldn't have anything to do with her success, would it?
Jesse: No... I don't know... Alright, I do know. I mean, I put her band together, me! I put the band together, she's a big star! I put my band together, we're playing dives! I promised myself that by the time I was 24 I'm going to have a record deal! I'm 24 1/2, when is it going to be my turn?
Joey: Hey, I know how that feels. It's like when I see Alf, I go nuts. I'm doing my stand up in little nightclubs, and a carpet sample has a series. But you know, if we hang in there, we're going to make it. Danny, why are you so upset with Caroline?
Danny: Because she wanted to make me dinner.
Joey: The real problem is you like her.
Danny: Okay, I do like her, and it scares me. Ever since Pam... everything is just so hard, so confusing.
Joey: I know how tough this has been on you. But that's how life is, it's a struggle. But what helps you get you through the tough times are the people by your side. So when people like Roxanna and Caroline come along, why push them away because you're frustrated with your career and because you're not ready to date yet? You're throwing away what could be great friendships.
Jesse: Is this the same guy who spends hours perfecting under arm noises? Where's this coming from?
Joey: From my heart. I did have some help with the words. It's what Scooby Doo told Scrappy Doo last Saturday morning.
Danny: Thanks Joey (they hug).
Jesse: Come here, you big goof (they hug).
Danny: Alright, we got in some male bonding after all. Would you guys excuse me for a moment? (in the living room) Caroline can I talk to you please? (back to the kitchen)
Caroline: Hi.
Danny: Hi. Look, I'm really sorry I flipped out. It's just that... Well, you know about my wife, and I'm just not ready for this yet. I really do like you. Do you think maybe you and I could... like... just be friends?
Caroline: I think that would be great (they hug).
Back in the living room.
Jesse: Roxanna, I guess what I'm trying to say is, maybe I was acting a little bit... What's the word I'm looking... insanely jealous.
Roxanne: Jesse, your time's going to come. You're to good.
Jesse: You know I can't go with you.
Roxanne: I know. I just want us to be together.
Jesse: Well, maybe someday we will be. But in the mean time, you've got to realize, a guy like me. I've got to be free wheeling, I've got to be riding on the wind, I've got to be living on the edge...
DJ, Stephanie, and Michelle reenter the house.
DJ: Hi, Uncle Jesse.
Stephanie: Can you help me off with my stinger?
Jesse: Sure kid... Well, I'm living on the edge of cuteness.

Episode 006 * Daddy's Home
No Teaser

DJ and Joey are in the living room, DJ wearing a blue dress, Joey wearing a Hawaiian shirt and multi colored tie, Stephanie is in a ballerina tutu and head phones, dances into the living room from the kitchen
Stephanie: One, two, three, four. One, two, three, four.
Joey: Stephanie, you've been rehearsing for three days straight. You're this close to ballerina burn out.
DJ + Joey: Stephanie (continues dancing).
Joey: Stephanie (continues dancing).
DJ +Joey: (remove Stephanie's head phones) Stephanie!
Stephanie: I am not Stephanie. I'm a swan who's about to kick the bucket (dances past Joey and collapses).
Joey: Oh God, there's a dead swan in the living room!
Stephanie: (rises) Joey, I'm alive. I was just acting.
Joey: No! Get out of town! Unbelievable!
A car pulls up to the house.
Stephanie: Uh oh, that's daddy! I don't want him to see me in my tutu until show time! YIKES (runs through the kitchen)!
Danny enters the house.
Danny: Sorry I'm late. I was editing my feature on Great Moments In Bowling, and I got held up when I couldn't find a second moment.
DJ: So dad, after Stephanie's recital, we hit the big sale at the Fashion Mart. Everything is half off.
Danny: Of course that doesn't save me any money, because you'll just buy twice as much stuff right?
DJ: I like your attitude.
Jesse comes down the stairs in a tuxedo.
Jesse: It's Saturday afternoon, I'm all dressed up, and where am I going? A munchkin ballet.
DJ: Uncle Jesse, hot outfit! Help Joey.
Jesse takes a look at Joey's clothes.
Jesse: (laughs) Very sharp Joseph! Where are you going after the ballet, Don Hoe's wedding?
The doorbell rings, Danny answers, a blonde girl in a brown dress enters
Adrianna: (Italian accent) Chao.
Danny: Jesse, it's for you.
Joey: How do you know she's not here to see me?
Adrianna: Jesse!
Jesse: Adrianna, have mercy! (they kiss) How are you?
Danny: (to Joey) If she's here to see you, she's very nice to your friends.
Jesse: Let me introduce you to my roommates. This is Danny Tanner, and this is King Camaya-maya. You'll never guess how I met this one.
Danny: A PTA meeting?
Jesse: Close, skydiving.
Adrianna: He missed the target, and dropped right into my Alpha Romeo.
Jesse: (Italian accent) 'Dropped right into my Alpha...' I love that. Anyway, she asked me to come back to her place, and it turned out her place was in Rome. Who would have known? Come on, I'll make you some Spaghetti-Os (they enter the kitchen).
Michelle squeaks, Danny picks her up
Danny: Michelle! Hi Michelle. Hi! Say dada, say dada, say da, say... say wasahalabdabadah. She's so close I can feel it. Say dada, come on.
Joey: (munchkin voice) Dada, okay! Now get off my back!
The phone rings, Danny answers, DJ and Stephanie reenter the room, Stephanie is in a pink overcoat.
Danny: Hello ... Really! The station wants me to cover the Game Of the Week! That's Great! ... (notices DJ and Stephanie) No, that's not great. Look, my little girl is having her first ballet recital. Any chance Stanford and UCLA could delay the kick off you know, like, 3 or 4 hours? ... Hey, I took a shot. Alright yeah, I'll be there.
Stephanie: You're going to miss my recital?
Danny: I'm really sorry honey. I feel terrible
DJ: It's okay, me and Stephanie understand that you have to work. But it's great having a dad on TV, right Stephanie?
Stephanie: Yeah that part's fun.
Danny: I guess this means we're going to miss the big sale too.
DJ: That's okay, we can go some other time, and pay full price.

Down in the basement Jesse and Adrianna are kissing, Joey enters
Jesse: Can I help you? (continues kissing)
Joey: I need to talk to you
Jesse: Go ahead, talk (continues kissing).
Joey: So here's what I'm thinking. I think I need to make some changes in my life.
Jesse: Bran, eat more bran (continues kissing).
Joey: What I mean by change is; more danger, more excitement, more... Adrianna!
Jesse: I'll be right back.
Adrianna: I'll be right here.
Jesse: (motions to Joey) Come here! Come here! Come here! What do you want?
Joey: I want your life! Were you always like this?
Jesse: No, I wasn't always like this. I was like you, then I turned four. I remember man, my dad bought me my first bike. I sailed out of the driveway, I ripped off the training wheels, packed a bag, and took off to adventure! If my dad hadn't snagged me, I'd have made it all the way to the Dairy Queen.
Joey: See, I love that story. That's what I want, a life with out training wheels!
Jesse: You something kid, I like you, and I think I can give you that life. But you've got to understand, when you're talking about a life like mine, you're talking about living on the edge man, you're talking about taking risks, you're talking about... buying a new wardrobe. Are you, Joseph Gladstone ready to make that kind of commitment (grips Joey)?
Joey: (grips Jesse) I am ready to be committed.


Later in the living room Jesse and Adrianna are on the couch eating whip cream covered strawberries
Jesse: So that's how you do it in Rome?
Adrianna: Right. Uh huh, and now I get one.
Danny enters
Danny: Jesse! Jesse (Adrianna drops the spoon full of whip cream)!
Jesse: What could you possibly want?
Danny: How was Stephanie's ballet recital?
Jesse: She came out, she danced, she died.
Danny: Oh God, I wish I could have been there! Alright, I rushed home, there's still time to take the girls shopping.
Jesse: Don't worry about it. I took care of it. I had to take Joey shopping, so I took the girls to the sale and saved you a few bucks.
Danny: (shocked) Oh, that was nice of you.
Jesse: Hey girls! Come on downstairs and model your new clothes for your dad! Let's go!
Adrianna: Jesse, why don't I just wait for you back at the hotel and I'll try on this cute little outfit you bought me? (waves a very small bag in front of Jesse) Bye (leaves).
Jesse: Have Mercy. (DJ is on the steps, motions to Jesse) Oh, you're going to love this (starts playing the organ). And now, the lovely Donna Joe (in a brown jacket, red sweater, red hat, and brown pants). Donna Joe is sporting that lovely fall look. She's got a tomato red hat for that tomato head look. (spins around, removes the jacket) And hey, look at those shoulders, too much baby. Thank you Donna Joe. And now Stephanie (in a multi colored dress, comes downstairs). The young Stephanie, just back from a show in Milan steps out in style in her multi colored print (spins once). And now, for the latest in the always exciting world of toddler fashion, the lovely, scintillating Michelle. (Michelle runs across the floor) Michelle is sporting a look that says 'hey babe, it's the late 80s, and I'm loving every minute of it.' (DJ picks her up) Come here you little weasel (Jesse takes Michelle).
Danny: Looks like I missed out on a really special day. My little girls, they're growing up so fast.
Jesse: (spits three times, and bangs on the organ keys) And now, taking a huge fashion risk, the ultimate macho macho man Big Joe Stud! (Joey enters wearing leather pants, leather jacket and red shirt).
Danny: Joey!
Joey: Shut up punk.
Danny: Joey, you know you actually make Michael Jackson look tough.
Jesse: Michelle, you're going to be such a fox when you get older.
Michelle: Dada.
Danny: Jesse, my little girl just called you dada.
Jesse: Oh no, she didn't call me dada. She... she called me doe doe. (turns Michelle to Danny) Here's your dad. Lay a 'dad' on him, come on.
Danny: Hi. Remember me. Remember I'm your biological dada.
Jesse: Now the guy's really asking for a 'dada'. Can't you give him a 'dada'? Come on, I'm your Uncle Jesse.
Michelle: Dada.
Jesse: I'm not your dad.
Joey: Here, give me the babe. (Joey takes Michelle)
Michelle: Dada.
Danny: (takes Michelle) Here. Hi, it's me, dada. Dada, dada, dada, dada. (Michelle does nothing). My sweet little baby, my own flesh and blood, thinks that you two are her father! Oh my God! My little baby doesn't have the foggiest idea who I am!
Joey: How many of really know who we are?
Danny: This is all my fault! I'm working too many hours, I've got to spend more time with my children! DJ and Stephanie come downstairs, Stephanie in a blue shirt, DJ in a pink dress.
Stephanie: Uncle Jesse bought us these to go clubbing.
DJ: Can we keep them dad?
Danny: Dad! (hands Michelle to Joey) She called me dad! (hugs DJ)Girls, I'm taking all three of you out for father daughter day!
Stephanie: Alright daddy!
Danny: She called me 'daddy' too! (hugs Stephanie) Later that night, Jesse and Joey drive into the garage on Jesse's motorcycle.
Jesse: How'd you like that ride?
Joey: Jesse, it was a revelation! I saw God! In fact, I think you we lapped him.
Jesse: Alright man, you've got the look, you've got the feel, now all you've got to do is get on a bike and ride to adventure.
Joey: Yeah baby, I'm hell bound! (jumps on Jesse's motorcycle)
Jesse: Whoa! Whoa! You ain't hell bound on my bike! Nobody rides my bike but me. If you need a bike, (takes him to one of the girls bicycles) take your pick. Oh, and if you miss that vimmmmm sound, put some cards in the spokes.
Joey: Do you know what you are? You're a bike tease. (Jesse gets on his motorcycle) You get a guy all fired up, and then you say 'uh uh! No'! Well, I want danger, I want adventure, I want to ride your pig!
Jesse: (walks to Joey) That's hog. Alright Joey, once around the block. Go ahead (Joey gets on the motorcycle). Now listen, you be very very careful. Do you hear me? (Joey starts the motorcycle). I can't watch this (leaves). The next day, Danny is in Stephanie and DJ's room at the base of Stephanie's bed with a video camera.
Stephanie: (sleepy) Daddy, why are you making feet movies?
Danny: Because I love you, and I love your little feet.
DJ: (sleepy) What's going on?
Stephanie: Daddy loves me, and he loves my little feet.
Danny: I want to preserve every minute of your lives.
DJ: I'm going to go and brush my teeth. Do you want to reload?
Danny: Wait a minute DJ. Girls, I have a surprise for you. I am not going to work today. Today is father daughter day part two. DJ +
Stephanie: YAY!
DJ: Wait a minute dad. How can you do this, Sunday's your busiest day?
Danny: I worked it out. I'm working New Year's Eave, but I worked it out. This is your day, we can do what ever you want to do. What do you want to do?
DJ: Can we take a cruise around the bay?
Danny: It's your day.
Stephanie: Then can we go horseback riding.
Danny: It's your day.
DJ: Then can we buy a big screen TV, a CD player, and a couple of mopeds?
Danny: Why don't I just get you your own MasterCard?
DJ: Oooooh it is my day. Switch to downstairs, the phone rings, Jesse answers.
Jesse: Hello! Joey! You've been gone since yesterday! Get your butt back here right now ... 'Chill out babe'? ... Listen you little leather-clad weasel! I created you, I can destroy you! Hello! (puts down the phone) I never taught him 'chill out'! Later that night, Joey enters the garage on Jesse's motorcycle
Joey: Safe!
Jesse: (behind a card board Santa Claus on a candy cane) Ho ho ho! (steps out in front) It's your last Christmas! Tell Santa what kind of tombstone you want!
Joey: Jesse!
Jesse: I said 'once around the block'! 'Once around the block'! Where were you?
Joey: Jesse, I can explain everything...
Jesse: Once! Do you know what 'once' means? Do you know what 'once' means? Danny enters with the girls.
Joey: Hi girls.
Jesse: Oh yeah, like that old trick is supposed to work!
DJ: Hi Uncle Jesse.
Stephanie: Hi Joey.
Jesse: (surprised) Hi girls! I was just... welcoming home Joseph.
Danny: Girls, let's give the boys a moment to get reacquainted. DJ +
Stephanie: (walk passed Jesse and Joey) Ooooooooh!
Danny: (with Michelle, walks passed Jesse and Joey) Ooooooooooh!
Jesse: Alright, speak geek. And you'd better have one hell of a story.
Joey: Jesse, as soon as I left the driveway, your spirit entered my body. I knew that it was your spirit because my hair expanded.
Jesse: Alright, alright, quit sucking up and tell the story.
Joey: Then she appeared. 5' 11", dressed from head to toe in red leather
Jesse: And what did my spirit tell you to do?
Joey: I threw the babe on the back of the bike, popped a wheelie, and said 'have mercy'!
Jesse: Now, that's my spirit. That's my spirit.
Joey: Then we cruised into Vegas, checked into Caesar's, hit the craps tables. An hour and a half later, I'm up $14,000.
Jesse: $14,000! That's a lot of money, and you've got a pretty girl. Did you... you know?
Joey: Yep, got married. Then it got interesting.
Jesse: Oh.
Joey: We hopped on a jet for the Big Apple
Jesse: Uh huh.
Joey: Helicoptered into Manhattan.
Jesse: Alright.
Joey: Where we quickly produced a revival of the Broadway smash 'Porgies and Bass'. You don't believe a word of this do you?
Jesse: Not a syllable.
Joey: Well, let's give the truth a whirl.
Jesse: Okay.
Joey: I met a girl who lives just down the street. She wasn't dressed in red leather, she had a nice wallet. So we went to her place, where I did win $14,000 (Jesse steps forward) in Monopoly money (Jesse backs away). Then I fell asleep on her couch. You believe that don't you?
Jesse: (walks to the motorcycle) I have to, you only put a mile and a half on the bike.
Joey: Jesse, I'm sorry I was gone so long. I hope I didn't let you down.
Jesse: No, you didn't let me down. Maybe you didn't have a wild and crazy adventure, but you had a cute little adventure-ette.
Joey: You know what I found out. No matter what I am wearing, or what I am riding on, I'm still going to be Joey. And you know what, that's okay.
Jesse: Damn right it's okay. Alright, Big Joe Stud.
Joey: Yeah, I guess I am pretty studly. Okay, out of my way dude. I'm going up stairs to take a bubble bath. That night Danny, DJ, and Stephanie are in DJ and Stephanie's room, DJ and Stephanie are in bed.
Danny: Great day, huh DJ?
DJ: Yeah, major fun. It was one of the best days of my life.
Danny: You don't sound all that happy.
DJ: I'm happy, honest (smiles). See, these are happy teeth!
Danny: I've known that face since it was the size of a tennis ball. That is not a DJ happy face.
DJ: Dad, for the last time I'm happy. Happy, happy, happy okay (gets out of bed, opens the closet).
Danny: Okay. (walks to Stephanie's bed) Stephanie honey, I'll bet you want to get yourself a glass of water.
Stephanie: I'm not dumb. You want me to leave, something's wrong.
Danny: Sweetie, I promise if something's wrong, we'll make it all better.
Stephanie: Alright (gets out of bed), but if you need me, I'll be in the bathroom drinking water and waiting (leaves).
Danny: (walks to DJ) DJ, what's going on here? You don't have to put on a happy act for me.
DJ: It wasn't for you, it was for Stephanie.
Danny: Well, Stephanie's not here honey. What's going on?
DJ: It's just hard being brave for my little sister all the time. Like when you couldn't take me shopping, I felt terrible. But I couldn't show it, because if I did, Stephanie would cry about you missing her recital.
Danny: DJ, you are a terrific big sister, (sits on DJ's bed, sets DJ on his lap) but no one has to put on an act in this house. Now, what's bothering you?
DJ: I don't know, today was so much fun. You took us horseback riding to the circus, to Marine World. But I kept getting sadder and sadder.
Danny: What part depressed you the most, the circus clowns or shammu? (DJ gets in bed) Honey, maybe you were sad for the same reason I was.
DJ: You were sad too.
Danny: A little bit, because the more fun we had, the more I hated to see it end.
DJ: I wish we could have days like this all the time, I really love being with you.
Danny: I love being with you to, but there's no easy answer here.
DJ: I know you have to work.
Danny: I wish I could be in two places at once, but I can't.
DJ: You know, I feel better.
Danny: You do?
DJ: Yeah, we didn't solve anything, but just talking about it helps.
Danny: It helps me too, and DJ I promise, I am going to find more time to spend with you girls.
DJ: And any time you want to see me, you can always pull me out of school. Especially if you want to see me during math class.
Danny: Now that's a DJ happy face. Come here you little tennis ball head (they hug).


Danny goes to Michelle's room.
Danny: Hi honey, you may not remember today, but it was one of the best days of my life. (kisses Michelle) I love you Michelle. Good night sweetheart. (closes the door)
Michelle: Dada.
Danny: (reenters) Yeah!

Trainer: It's about respect. Pride and respect. The Sandman wants to go down as the greatest champion inthe history of boxing.

Danny is tugging at his shorts, revealing her very colorful tie tack
Stephanie: My tie tack.

Danny: Oh, this. This is a gift from my daughter Stephanie, and the tie is a gift from my daughter DJ.. And, I have a little baby daughter Michelle, but you can't wear her gifts.
Others: Yaaay.
Danny: You probably haven't seen much of your family during your 3 months of training.
Sandman: No. He runs a pretty tough camp.
Trainer: the toughest. (Grabs mike) Total isolation. Just me, the Sandman,a nd the ring. No women, no phone calls, no nothing.

Sandman: considering? Considering what?
Danny: You know...
Trainer: yeah, right, champ, just loosen up, baby.
Sandman: Hey, hey, the man said considering. Considering what?
Danny: Uh, considering what happened.
Trainer: Loosen up, champ.
Sandman: I'm gonna loosen somebody's head if I don't get some answers. Now lsiten, you said it's great my wife and I are still friends. Why wouldn't we still be friends?
Danny: So about tonight's fight, let's talk strategy. (Sandman grabs him and lifts him up) Let's forget about strategy. Uh, all I meant was when a woman moves out on a man they stop being friends.
Sandman: (putting him down gently) She moved out?
Trainer: Hey, c'mon, champ, let's fight.
Sandman: You expect me to fight when my wife just moved out on me?
Trainer: that's it, champ, use the anger.
Danny: Oh, champ, I'm sorry. Oh, boy am I sorry. I can't believe you didn't know about this.
Sandman: You callin' me a liar?
Danny: Oh, not at all. Why would I choose those as my last words. I jsut figured since the story was inthe newspapers, and the magazines, and the soon to be released TV move...
Sandman: She left me? And sold the rights for...oh, no, no, Marcie baby, noooo. (He starts crying on Danny's shoulder) Oh, no, baby, no.
Danny: It'll be okay, champ, it'll be okay.
Trainer: You're kinda takin' the edge off him, eh, Tanner?
Danny: You knwo, this is kind of a beautiful moment. Thanks for sharing it with us. And Sandman, good luck on tonight's fight.
Sandman: Fight? I can't fight.
Trainer: Sure you can. (Leading him away)
Sandman: C'mon, I can't fight now.
Trainer: Sure you can, you'll knock him out.
Stephanie: Why was that man crying?
Jesse: Well, that man was crying because...your dad made him so happy.
Stephanie: I don't think so.
Danny: Well, we'll be back after this word from anbody but me.
Stephanie: Now what happens?
Jesse: Well, two guys beat each other up for about 36 minutes, and after that, each of 'em gets 6 million dollars.
Stephanie: $6 million. Forget about being a ballerina.
Joey: Uh, girls, maybe you shouldn't be watching all this violence.
DJ: Joey's right, Steph. Let's go watch reruns of the A-team. (They leave.)


Jesse: there it is, she coughed again. This cough's gettin' serious. I'll think of something. (Looks at Joey, who has the phone): What are you doin'?
Joey: Calling the baby's doctor.
Jesse: good. I knew I'd think of something.
Joey: Hello, Dr. Landress? You're home? You answer your own phone? Are you any good? (Pauses) Yeah, I'm calling about Michelle Tanner. She's coughing. Hold on, Doc. (To Jesse): He wants to know what kind of cough.
Jesse: what kind of...(takes the phone) It's a little baby's cough! It's like this - (does a tiny cough)
Joey: (takes phone) Doc, I do impressions for a living, it was more like this. (Does a different kind of baby cough, but more hacking)
Jesse: Give me the phone! (Into phone): I'm sorry, we're new parents. All right, come here, listen to Michelle cough. All right, cough, Michelle. (Holds the phone up to her, she is quiet): Come on, cough. Come on. (To Joey): It's just like when you take your car to a mechanic, it never makes the same noise. (Takes phone back): All right...her nose? It's running like a fountain...What's comin out of it? Diet cola!...Fever, I don't know....Of course I know how to take her temperatore, you simply stick the thermometer under her tongue...I put it where?!?! (Hands the phone to Joey): Joey, it's for you.

(Next scene, looking at thermometer with clown on the end)
Jesse: Down, a little tot he right...normal. No temperature. Hi five, Michelle. Hi five. (She does it) Okay.
Joey: Well, doctor said no fever means it's a cold and we should give her the same medicine he prescribed for the last cold. (Looks at bathroom cabinet): Okay, we've got strawberry mousse, apricot conditioner, honey nut rinse; can you believe these girls put all this dumb junk int heir hair?
Jesse: It's mine. What are you lookin' at.
Joey: All right, here it is, Michelle Tanner, four times a day.
DJ: (As she ans Steph walk in) the fight's over, Dad'll be back on after these important messages.
Stephanie: What are you doing to Michelle?
Jesse: We're giving your sister some medicine.
Stephanie: that's not the way Daddyd oes it.
Jesse: Stephanie...All right, here you go Michelle. (She hits the spoot, medicine goes flying onto Joey's face) Joey, duck.


(Next scene is a hand with a teaspoon trying to come up under the high chair top with Michelle in it, she keeps backigna way)
Joey: Well, so much for cough syrup with pureed chicken.
Jesse: I told you it would never work, you never serve red cough syrup with poultry.
DJ: By the way, if I'm ever sick, dial 9-1-1.
Stephanie: Daddy's on!
(They bring Michelle and the high chair into the living room)
Danny: Well, fans, you saw if; 1:17 into the second round, Reggie the Sandman Martin was k.o.'ed. He may have been a little off tonight; that happens. But, I don't thinkt he blame should be laid at anybody's feet. I mean anybody. Am I being clear? A blameless defeat.
Reporter: Hey, how does it feel to have personally dealt a crushing blow to a man's career?
Danny: Are you talking about my own career or his?
Another reporter: Do you have some kind of a personal grudge against the Sandman?
Danny: Not at all; the Sandman and I have always had a very warm and cordial relationship.
Sandman: I want him! I want him! I want Danny tanner! I want him!
Danny: Can't you just feel the love?

(In the locker room afterward, everyone oohs and ahhhs there and at the Tanner home)
Danny: Walk with me, as I personally apologize to the Sandman. Sandman, I am really very, very sorry.
Sandman: it's okay. It's not your fault. At least someone had the guts to tell me about my wife. Youw coudln't happen to know why she left me, would you?
Danny: Well, maybe not seeing your wife for 3 or 4 months resulted in a teensy loss of intimacy.
Trainer: It's okay, Champ, we don't need her.
Sandman: (To trainer) What's this 'we' stuff; it's this 'we' stuff that got me in trouble. You talked me out of retirement because you needed the money; you knew about my wife all the time, didn't you?
Trainer: Well, I kinda got an inkling when I read the cover story in Sports Illustrated.
Sandman: Marcie, I'm gonna give up boxing, I'm gonna find ya and I'm gonna beg for forgiveness because I love you, baby. (Blows several kisses to her) Lou, you're fired. (He wlkas off)
Trainer: Tanner, this whole thing is your fault. (Punches him, but hurts his own hand ont he tie tack)
Danny: (opening his suit coat) Thanks, Stephanie.
Stephanie: your'e welcome, Daddy. Didn't Daddy do great? (Everyone agrees)
Jesse: he was quite good this evening.
Joey: Yeah, girls, nobody can take a punch like your father.
Stephanie: can we stay up till Daddy gets home?
Jesse: Oh, no girls, you go to bed, get some sleep. Tomorrow we may have to move to a civilization without television.
DJ and Stephanie: Goodnight. (They leave)
Jesse: Good nght. (To Joey): All right, Joey, I give up, you give her her medicine.
Joey: Okay, Michelle, here it comes. Mmmm, vrmmm. (She closes her mouth, avoids the cough syrup.) Oh, come on, it tastes really good. Watch this. (Makes same small airplane noises, but pushes the spoon of syrup into a suprised Jesse's mouth.) Smile, the baby's watching you. (He smiles, against his will.)
Jesse: Mmm.
Joey: And she's waiting for her Uncle Jesse to swallow.
Jesse: (swallows) Mmm...this stuff is terrible.
Joey: but you're not coughing, are you?
Jesse: All right, that's it. Enough fooling around, Michelle. This is the last teaspoon of medicine. Now, you're gonna take it, and you're gonna feel better, and you're gonna do it right now. Come on. (She starts to take it) Right now, come on. (She takes and swallows it.) See, Joey. All I had to do was ask nice.

(Danny comes home dejected, flops on sofa)
Joey: danny...
Danny: Please, don't bother lying to me. I stunk.
Joey: I just want you to know that Michelle's going to be fine.
Danny: (getting up quickly) What?
Joey: Well, the baby was sick, but she's fine now.
Danny: The baby was sick. Well, why didn't you say something?

(Jesse is singing to her, hard to tell what he's singing, she's trying to repeat)
Danny: Michelle, Daddy's here. (Picks her up and cuccles her): Jesse, what's wrong?
Jesse: Ah, just a little cold.
Danny: How do you know it's a little cold?
Jesse: She had a cough and a runny nose, but no fever.
Danny: She should have fluids.
Jesse and Joey: Done.
Danny: We should call the doctor.
Jesse and Joey: Done!
Danny: really. Has she had her cough medicine?
Jesse and Joey: Done!
Danny: about changing her diaper?
Jesse and Joey: Good night.

(In the kitchen)
Danny: Well, the baby's asleep. Her cold sounds much better. You guys were really great tonight.
Jesse: Yep. We're startin' to learn how to take care of the kid.
Joey: I'll drink tot hat.
Danny: I can't thank you guys enough.
Jesse: We really love that little (they sneeze) germ-spreading phlegm faucet.
Danny: you knwo, ehn I came home tonight, I was so down. But, then I heard Michelle was sick, and it put everything back into perspective. I realized what's really important is my family, and my friends.
Joey: So you forgot all about that nightmare of an interview.
Danny: Right up untilt his very moment,w hen you were kind enough to bring it up again. I was horrible.
Jesse: come on, horrible's sucha harsh word, you were...well, yeah, you were horrible.
Danny: isn't this suposed to be where you guys jump in with a nice little pep talk?
Joey: Oh, I dn't know if I've got one in me, Danny.
Jesse: What do you think I am, a saint?
Danny: Come on, I'll get you started. How about, 'Every cloud has a cilver lining,' or, 'The sun'll come out tomorrow.'
Joey: (Not sure what impresion he's doing, sounds liek a coach or trainer, though) I can feel it. The pep is coming up, it's in my stomche, it's working its way north, it's in my throat and...pep. (He gets up, goes over to Danny) Danny, nobody's career goes straight up. You had one rough night. There's always bumps along the way.
Danny: this is good, don't stop.
Joey: And don't interrupt. The key, danny, is to learn from all those little bumps, so you'll be better prepared for next time. (Regulr voice): Because you will have other chances.
Danny: When? I need a date and a t time.
Joey: Soon. Because you're good at what you do. You know why? Because you care about more than jsut scores and stats. You care about people. Right, Jess?
Jesse: Yeah, why not.
Joey: And, in your own, unique way, you helped the Sandman. People trust you. Because they know you're a great guy. Right, Jesse?
Jesse: Yeah, why not?
Danny: thanks, guys.
Jesse: My favorite part was whent he manager punched him. (Makes sound like someone getting punched)
Joey: I love it when he brought tears to the Sandman's eyes.
Jesse: Yeah, and the reporters outside throwin' stuff
Danny: yeah, and I loved when I said there was noone to blame. I loved how bad that was.
(Scene ends with them laughing, though we can't see it, as the things that went on that night)

DJ: So Kimmy, do you want to stay for dinner?
Kimmy: Maybe, what are you having?
DJ: Joey's cooking, so I'm not really sure? It's something in earth tone.
Kimmy: Pass, but if my dog Sinbad is hungry I'll send him over.
Stephanie enters
Stephanie: Don't do that, I love Sinbad!
DJ: Stephanie, why are you following us?
Stephanie: Because you keep leaving me.
DJ: Stephanie, I know you are only five and you have no life of your own. But Kimmy and I are talking woman to woman.
Stephanie: I'm a woman, I'm a little woman, but I'm a woman.
DJ: Stephanie, when Kimmy leaves, you and I can have a nice sister to sister talk, unless I get a phone call.
Stephanie: (pats DJ on the shoulder) You're so good to me.
A mysterious howling noise comes from somewhere in the garage.
Stephanie: Did you guys hear that noise? It sounded like a monster.
DJ: Stephanie, you're always making up monster noises. There's nothing to worry about.
Kimmy: Although, you do look like that kid in Poltergeist who got sucked up in the TV and said 'They're back!'.
Stephanie: Real funny.

Switch to the kitchen, Michelle is in a high chair, Joey is cooking dinner.
Joey: (Japanese accent, clapping spice containers) Hoo ha hee ahh hoe! Ooh, you gonna love this Michelle. Haitomoto hatu (pounds the counter and sends a piece of broccoli flying through the air) ooh, tumatugasu, tumatugasu, hu ha (turns to his left, catches the broccoli in the salad bowl) ooh!

Jesse: Hi.
Joey: (Japanese accent) Hi.
Jesse: (Japanese accent) Hi
Joey: (Japanese accent) Hi.
Jesse: (Japanese accent) How you donin'?
Joey: (Japanese accent) How you donin'?
Jesse + Joey: (Japanese accent) Oooooooooaaaahhh!
Stephanie and DJ enter from downstairs.
Stephanie: Uncle Jesse, something horrible is in the house!
Jesse: (examines Joey's cooking) You're telling me.
Joey: Hey Jesse, grab Michelle, and help me set the table, will you (takes a pot to the table)?
Jesse: Alright, come on Michelle (picks up the high chair).
Danny enters from the side.
Danny: Great news, I've got great news!
Stephanie: Thank goodness you're home (hugs Danny's leg)!
Danny: I missed you too honey. Did you miss all of me or just my leg?
DJ: Stephanie thinks she heard a monster in the garage, but if you ask me it's just a desperate plea for attention.
Danny: DJ, stop watching Oprah and start doing your homework. (picks up Stephanie) So, now you're hearing a garage monster instead of just that closet monster, which by the way honey we never really found.
Stephanie: Maybe because the closet monster moved into the garage.
Danny: (walks to the table) Just to catch everybody up, I walked in here saying 'hey great news! Great news!'
Jesse: Oh I've got great news, I met a girl today.
Joey: That's not news, that's sports.
DJ: Let's give dad a break. (takes a seat) So what's your 'great news! Great news!'?
Danny: (takes a seat at the table, Stephanie is next to him) Okay thank you. As you know, all the TV stations in this city are fighting each other tooth and nail for better ratings...
Stephanie: Congratulations daddy!
Danny: Stephanie honey, that's not the great news. Anyway, my station is putting together a special promo, kind of a little commercial, about each of its newscasters, and here comes the great news Stephanie. They've picked your father to be first!
Stephanie: Oh great, yeah.
Jesse: Yeah, that's good.
Danny: I can feel the energy. Oh, by the way, you're all going to be on TV with me?
All: Yeah!
Danny: Oh, I knew you'd be happy for me. So, they're coming to the house tomorrow to film our whole family.
Joey: Alright!
DJ: Yeah!
Joey: I like that. Alright, everybody chow down (all take one taste of the food and turn away).
Jesse: Should we send out for pizza or Chinese?
All � Joey: Pizza.
Joey: It is pizza.


Later that night, DJ and Stephanie are asleep, Stephanie hears the same noise from earlier.
Stephanie: (turns on a light) They're back!
DJ: (sleepy) Stephanie, did you make that noise?
Stephanie: Why would I make a noise that's scaring me to death? Can I sleep with you in your bed?
DJ: Alright, come on over.
Stephanie: Does this mean you believe me about the monster?
DJ: I'm not saying yes, and I'm not saying no. I'm just saying get over here.
Stephanie: What if he's under the bed waiting to eat my feet? (crawls to a box at the base of her bed, throws DJ a string) Reel me in DJ! Faster! Faster! Faster! (the box reaches the bed, Stephanie gets in) Bless you.
DJ: You forgot to turn off the light.
Both hear the same noise.
Stephanie: Forget the light, run for your life!
The girls run into the hall.
DJ: Help! Help!
Jesse: Mon (Jesse enters from a side door, picks up Stephanie) ster!
Danny enters from the right.
Danny: What's going on?
Stephanie: We've got the monster trapped in our room!
DJ: Go get it Uncle Jesse, you're a creepy crawler killer!
Jesse: I'm a pest control specialist, thank you.
DJ: Pardon me. Go kill it!
Danny: Jesse, humor them. Unless there is something creepy and crawly in there, in which case (opens DJ and Stephanie's door) go kill it.
Jesse: You know, in every movie the hero is always a soldier, a cop, or a private i. Never once, never once have they made a movie about the real American hero, the exterminator (enters the room).
DJ + Stephanie + Danny: Pest control specialist.
Jesse: Coming soon to a theater near you.
Stephanie: Daddy, can I sleep with you in your bed tonight?
Danny: Oh honey, you don't want to sleep in my bed do you?
Stephanie: I guess not.


Later that night Danny finds himself in DJ's bed with DJ and Stephanie.
Danny: Your Uncle Jesse says that your room is monster free. So, I'm only staying here until you two fall asleep.
DJ: (sleepy) Okay dad.
Stephanie: (sleepy) Alright daddy.
Danny: And you two really need your sleep, because tomorrow the nice lady is coming here and she's going to make a little movie about our family. And girls, there are no such things is monsters. The closest thing in real life are linebackers, but they're much bigger than monsters, and they make a lot more money. Get it girls, more money. Girls? (DJ and Stephanie are asleep) Good night. (tries to leave, but soon finds himself trapped between the girls, he moves DJ, but she collapses on his right leg) Okay. (takes his free leg and rests it on a chair, takes a stuffed Elmo doll from a stand near the left of the bed, places it on a stand near the right of the bed, lays down his head, turns out the lamp). The joys of fatherhood.

Next day, Jesse and Joey are dressing Michelle in Michelle's room.
Jesse: Come on.
Joey: Okay Michelle, this is your big TV debut. Let's give you that Marilyn Monroe look, kind of. Yeah bangs sweeping to the left, curls framing the face (starts messing with her hair).
Jesse: She's got a look that could pull that off, but I think it would be a crime to cover this pretty little face. See, I say we pull it back, and give her a more sophisticated kind of look. More of a Madonna, Briguette Neilson kind of thing (pulls her hair back).
Joey: That's Jack Nickleson. Why don't we give her kind of a Pebbles Flintstone, kind of a... a fun due? (pulls her hair up)
Jesse: That's Don King.
Joey: Maybe just a bow.
Jesse: Bow, good idea. Simple, yet it screams style. I'll hold it up like this.
Joey: Okay. Finger.
Jesse: Okay, tie it first...
Joey: There we go.
Jesse: Alright good.
Joey: There we go, finger.
Jesse: Alright, now should we get her Wee Bots or her Little Glens?
Joey: One of each.
Jesse: Okay (takes some shoes from under the table), we've got that... (realizes his hand is tied to Michelle's head). You didn't just...
Joey: Yeah I think I did.
Jesse: That's what I thought.
Joey: Yeah.
Jesse: (tries to pull his hand loose) Baby yo-yo. Take it off.
Joey: Alright (removes the bow). They hear the strange noise
Jesse: Did you hear that noise?
Joey: Yeah, the girls were right. It's the monster.
Jesse: Shh, it's not a monster. Now, I have to find out where it's coming from. Be quiet (listens, hears the same noise). Ah ha! A North American silver footed ferret, adult male, 2 1/2 pounds. I'd say from the echo, he's heading towards the garage.
Joey: How can you possibly know this?
Jesse: It's a gift. Alright, come on out pal! This is your last warning! Get out now or be another notch on my spray gun! Hahahahaha!


Jesse heads for the garage, Joey enters.
Jesse: Alright pal (moves some boxes) come on out! It's just you and me, man verses ferret (picks up a baseball glove). Come on!
Joey: Who are you trying to catch, Phil Neacroe?
Jesse: Joseph, I have to improvise. I left my tools in the car. Listen, in order to catch a ferret, you must become one with the ferret.
Joey: Oh sure, like this (imitates a squeaking mouse).
Jesse: Joey, when you were a kid did you fall out of a tree house?
Joey: Yeah.
Jesse: There he is, there he is! Look out, I've got him! (runs to the left of the garage) I've got him, alright!
Joey: What are you going to do to him?
Jesse: Think of it this way, I'm moving senior ferret one step up into spiritual enlightenment.
Joey: What's the next step up for a ferret?
Jesse: Somewhere between rat and lawyer.
Joey: Well, if you were after a lawyer, I'd be right behind you. But we're talking about one of God's innocent little creatures (opens the garage door). Go! Run ferret! Go! Get out! Go! Go! Go! (Jesse gets a net, Joey steps in front of him, singing) Born free, as free as the wind... (ferret noise).
Jesse: There he goes. There he goes
Switch to the living room, the doorbell rings, DJ and Stephanie answer, a dark haired woman in a blue dress stands on the other side.
DJ: Hi, are you the lady that's going to put us on TV?
Ronnie: Yes I am, because you are so adorable! Let me see you smile! (they smile) Wonderful! Let me see if you can find a place to put my coat. (DJ hangs the coat over Michelle's play pen) Adorable, and you take direction too. My name's Ronnie, that's short for Veronica.
DJ: I'm DJ, that's short for Donna Joe.
Stephanie: I'm Stephanie, I'm just short.
Downstairs, Jesse is in a crawl space in the garage, Joey moves a ladder.
Jesse: Joey, give me the ladder.
Joey: I'm not putting the ladder back until we have a talk.
Jesse: Talk.
Joey: You have to promise me that if you capture the ferret, that you will let him go in a safe and pleasant environment.
Jesse: Okay fine, I'll capture him, I'll buy him a little ferret condo, fix him up with a hot little mink, and send him to Club Med for the winter.
Joey: Okay, but now let's talk about Major Medical.
Jesse: Help me down here (gives Joey an arm).
Joey: I've got you.
Jesse: Good. (DJ, Stephanie, and Ronnie enter)
Jesse + Joey: Hello!
DJ: These guys help take care of us.
Ronnie: This is Danny Tanner's family?
Jesse: I'm Jesse.
Joey: I'm Joey.
Ronnie: I'm in trouble.


Later in the living room.
Ronnie: People! People, we're almost ready!
Danny enters.
Danny: Hi, I'm Danny Tanner. You must be Ronnie Gardner, I've been looking forward...
Ronnie: Great, you're here, let's go.
Danny: to meeting you.
Joey: (taking down his decorations, a cardboard Jupiter) Well, that's the last of it.
Danny: Joey, where are you going with Jupiter?
Joey: Ronnie suggested that I move out.
Danny: Why would Ronnie suggest that?
Joey: No. No Danny, it's okay. It's no problem. A successful comedian like myself doesn't need exposure on TV. Working in parks and train stations is my rocket to stardom
Danny: Ronnie, don't you think Joey is important?
Ronnie: Important? Why, he's essential! He is going to be holding the cue cards (hands Joey a set of large pieces of card board). Thank you Joey.
Joey: Oh no, thank you Ronnie, you've given my life new meaning.
Ronnie: You know Danny, so many sportscasters are your typical macho, two fisted, iron pumping, ex jocks.
Danny: Yeah, that's me in a nutshell.
Ronnie: Well Danny Tanner, I am going to set you apart from the crowd. I am going to sell your family with class, style, sophistication.
Danny: That's me too. There are so many me.
Ronnie: We're just going to do this one rehearsal. If you have any problems... well, you won't. Outside, don't come back in until I say action. Okay everybody over here. Come on, let's go. Come on, alright. Ready. You back here (crew moves to the right of the room) And action!
Danny: (reading the cue card) Chao family... Chao family?
Ronnie: Si! Si! Continue.
Danny: Okay, this is the Italian me. Chao familia.
Ronnie: Okay, everybody around. Yeah. Good, here we go. Sit! (Danny sits on the couch) Cue DeVinci!
Danny: DeVinci?
A giant poodle comes in from the side and sits on Danny's lap.
Danny: Why is there a four-legged marshmallow on my lap?
Joey: Danny, this is no fru fru poodle. This is a man's poodle. This is a poodle on steroids.
Ronnie: Cue the girls! Girls! Girls! Girls! DeVinci's a rap! (the poodle leaves).
DJ and Stephanie enter from the side in matching white shirts and black skirts, DJ is carrying a violin.
Danny: (reading the cue card) Good day Donna Joe, and a good day to you too little Stephanie.
DJ: Oh father, how excellent to see you.
Stephanie: We missed you papa.
Danny: Wait I'm confused. Are we French or Italian... or Rogueford?
Ronnie: Girls sit! Cue housekeeper!
Jesse enters from the kitchen with a tea set.
Jesse: (fake tears) Hi ho, tea time at the Tanners
Danny: Now we're English?
Jesse: No no no no, you silly bloke. I'm the English one, you twit.
Danny: Thank you so much Mr. French.
Jesse: You're welcome, Uncle Bill. Excuse me (passes Ronnie). Buffy? Jody?
Joey: Now you know why I didn't fight too hard to stay in this thing.
Danny: What does any of this have to do with our family?
Ronnie: People! People! Focus! Focus! Crew over by the door! Come on let's go! And you right here (drags Danny to the center of the room)! Cue the baby Michelle!
Danny: Oh baby Michelle. Come to daddy honey.
A dark haired girl in a similar white shirt and black skirt enters from the kitchen.
Amanda: Hi daddy (hugs Danny)..
Danny: Hi honey. (to Ronnie) Oh, she's so cute, she's so adorable. Who is she?
Ronnie: She's your adopted daughter. We thought it would be great for your image.
Danny: Honey, is your mommy or daddy near by?
Amanda: In the kitchen.
Danny: In the kitchen, okay. Well, you go in there and see them (she leaves). She's so cute, almost as cute as my little baby. Where is my baby?
Ronnie: I wanted to go for the adopted daughter. Actually, Michelle just wasn't quite right for the part.
Danny: You're saying my daughter wasn't right for the part of my daughter?
Joey: I auditioned for the part, and I came that close.
Danny: I don't believe this! How could you guys let yourselves get talked into this?
Jesse: Well, we knew this was important it was to you, and ... well, we played along, just in case you actually went for this crazy cartoon.
Ronnie: I don't think you understand. Television news is a very competitive market. You've got to do something different. You've got to make some noise. You've got to make a splash.
Danny: I think you've splashed down from another planet! Wait, I'm getting a vision. I'm seeing a loving family. I'm seeing friends who will do anything to help each other (Jesse and Joey wave). Do you know what I'm seeing? I'm seeing my children playing the part of my children.
Joey: Nice!
Jesse: Sweet, not insane!
Ronnie: It's been done
Danny: Yeah, but not buy us! Hey I'm proud of who we are! And unless you want to show people the real Tanner family, I'm just going to have to direct this thing myself.
Ronnie: If you're going to direct, then what am I going to do?
Jesse: Oh, it's quite simple Ronnie (takes the cue cards from Joey). You will hold the cue cards!


Later that night, the family gathers in the living room.
Jesse: Alright, quiet everybody. It's on, it's on. Watch this.
The commercial:
Danny enters his house.
Danny: Hello, I'm Danny Tanner, and I do the sports for Channel 8 Newsbeat. Every day at 4, 6, and 10 you're kind enough to invite me into your home and make me a part of your family. Well, I'd like to introduce you to my family. Follow me, like you have a choice. Come on, don't be afraid. (the camera focuses on Danny's feet) Meet my stairs, my loafers, my socks, my slacks. Danny then enters Stephanie and DJ's room, DJ and Stephanie are sitting at their table.
Danny: Right this way. Oh there you are. Hi girls, daddy's home!
DJ + Stephanie: Hi dad! (Danny kisses the girls)
Danny: This happens every night, I swear. This is my daughter DJ, and this is Stephanie. Look girls, dad brought home a camera crew.
DJ: We know dad.
Stephanie: Yeah daddy, you came up here five minutes ago and told us.
Danny: Honesty, I teach my girls honesty.
DJ: Watch my dad do the sports weeknights on Channel 8
Stephanie: At 4, 6, and 10.
DJ + Stephanie: Don't miss him!
Danny: Marketing, I also teach them marketing.
Danny enters Jesse's room, Jesse and Joey are with Michelle.
Danny: This way, this way. Boy you move fast. This is my other little girl Michelle. Is she ready?
Jesse: Is she ready? Are you ready Michelle? Are you ready? Okay. Let's do a La Bamba thing for the Bay area.
Michelle: Lalalalala...
Jesse: (covers her moth) Bamba.
Danny: These guys are also a part of my family. You see, I'm a single parent, and they help me take care of my kids. This is my brother in law Jesse, he has a rock band called Jesse Cochrin And the Rippers.
Jesse: Hi mom.
Danny: And this is my good friend Joey Gladstone. Joey's a stand up comic.
Joey: And of course, I'm much funnier than I am right now.
Michelle squeaks.
Danny: Yes Michelle, say Hi San Francisco.
Joey: (munchkin voice, with Michelle) Hi San Francisco, please watch my daddy. He needs the work. I outgrow my clothes every four months.
Danny: Honesty, marketing, and begging for ratings. Welcome to my world. This is...
All: Danny Tanner, Channel 8 Action Sports.
DJ: Dad, can I have a raise in allowance? You'd like to see that, wouldn't you folks?
Danny: Kids, God love them.
DJ: Write letters!
Back to reality:
Joey: To be perfectly honest, it needed a poodle.
Danny: You guys were great.
DJ: Does this mean I get the raise in allowance?
Danny: Let's wait and see how many letters we get.
Stephanie: I bet you we get 18 tomorrow.
DJ: Stephanie!
Stephanie: Oops!
Danny: Okay, everybody who wants a sugar rush, into the kitchen for ice cream sodas.
DJ: (they run to the kitchen) I want chocolate!
Jesse: Maybe a nice banana split.
Joey: I hear you. (ferret noise)
Jesse: Ah ha, senior ferret returns.
Joey: Yeah and he's making you look really bad.
Jesse: This time he is mine! Alright, buddy come on! Come on (goes behind the organ)!
Joey: Hey Jesse, remember our deal, a condo, a mink, and Club Med.
Jesse pulls out the ferret
Jesse: Ah ha! Just as I suspected. A North American silver footed ferret, 2 1/2 pounds, adult male (shows Joey). Joey, he's a pest, and he's a varmint. The only way to dispose of this menace is... I'm going to take him to Big Sur and let him go free.
Joey: Oh, you big lug, your heart's as big as your hair.
Jesse: Alright, let's take him into the kitchen, show the girls there's no monster. Alright.
Jesse + Joey: (singing) Born free, as free as the wind blows... (they enter the kitchen).

Episode 010 * The Miracle of Thanksgiving
No Teaser

In Michelle's room
Danny: Happy Thanksgiving, Michelle. Today you have an opportunity that only comes around once in your career as a baby. You can blow everyone away at Thanksgiving dinner...by uttering one simple word: Turkey.Turkey. Turkey, turkey, turkey. I'm sorry, you don't need this kind of pressure, do you?
In Jesse's room
Danny: Happy Thanksgiving.
Jesse: Why is there a Butterball on my head?
Danny: Jesse, apparently your hair is some sort of baby magnet.
Jesse: Man, it's 7:00, it's a holiday, good night.
Danny: Jesse, I am sorry, but I've got a little problem...and I need to see you and Joey downstairs right now. Come on.
Jesse: I gotta get a lock for my door.
Danny: We're coming to some stairs, I recommend you opening your eyes.

In the living room
Danny: Joey, come on. Wake up, buddy.
Joey: Good morning, how you guys doing? Boy, it's great to be alive. Happy Thanksgiving, buddy.
Jesse: Why can't you wake up grumpy and grouchy like normal people?
Joey: Because it's a beautiful day.
Jesse: Yeah.
Danny: Boys, brace yourselves. It's snowing in Tacoma.
Jesse: No. Boy, it's a good thing I didn't sleep through that news.
Danny: You don't understand, my mom lives in Tacoma and she's snowed in. She was supposed to make our Thanksgiving dinner for us.
Joey: It's no problem, we'll make that seven-course meal ourselves. How, you ask? The miracle...of Thanksgiving.
Jesse: You...are a moron. There's a miracle of Christmas and there's Smokey Robinson and The Miracles, there's Miracle Whip. But there's no miracle of Thanksgiving, huh.
Joey: Oh, no? Suppose the Pilgrims had landed in Florida. We'd all be eating flamingo.
Danny: All I know is, everything today has to be absolutely perfect.
Jesse: Why?
Danny: Because it's the girls' first Thanksgiving without their mother.
Jesse: That's right. That's gotta be rough on them. We gotta make this a fun day, a great day for them.
Joey: And it will be, you know why?
Jesse: Why?
Joey: The miracle...of Thanksgiving. Now let's get in there and cook.
Jesse: Right. Right after that we'll hunt for eggs left by the Thanksgiving Bunny.


In the kitchen
Danny: Okay, everything's on the table and ready for cooking. What should we make first?
Jesse: Reservations.
Danny: I know this looks a little intimidating but families all over this country are turning these ingredients into a Thanksgiving feast.
Jesse: Maybe we should go have dinner with one of them.
Joey: Nobody panic, we've got cookbooks. If you can read English, you can cook. For instance: "Basic bread stuffing. Melt one-third cup butter in a heavy skillet."
Danny: That's easy. On the stove, right?
Jesse: No, we stick the butter in a rocket ship and send it to the sun.
Joey: All right. Guys, stay with me here. "Add one-fourth cup finely minced onion."
Danny: We've got three different kinds of onion here. Are there any pictures?
Joey: Well, here's one of Betty Crocker, but they cut her off above the onions. Okay. "Stir in four cups breadcrumbs. See pages 35 to 37. Two cups chicken stock. See pages 46 to 48. One pound pork sausage. See pages 78 to 81." Stuffing is highly overrated.
Jesse: Hey, mister, what happened to the miracle...with the horn thing, of Thanksgiving?
Joey: If we can get a restaurant reservation on Thanksgiving, there's your miracle.
DJ & Stephanie: Happy Thanksgiving.
Danny, Joey & Jesse: Happy Thanksgiving.
DJ: Look out. Here comes big, bad biker mama.
Jesse: Michelle. Michelle. Pop a wheelie. Pop a wheelie. All right. See, I taught her everything I know.
Danny: Girls, I have a little bad news. It's snowing up north, and Grandma can't make it.
DJ & Stephanie: Oh, no.
Danny: But don't worry we're going to the best restaurant in town for a super-great Thanksgiving feast. It's quiz time. How is Thanksgiving gonna be?
Stephanie: Super great.
Danny: That's correct. And now, DJ to tie, how is Thanksgiving gonna be?
Stephanie: Time's up. What do I win?
DJ: Steph, how could you say that sounds super great? I think the idea stinks.
Stephanie: Can I change my vote?
Danny: DJ, what's wrong?
DJ: Mom always cooked us a home-cooked meal for Thanksgiving. Don't you think we should have Thanksgiving here?
Danny: Yeah, we're just a little nervous about turning all this food into something that can still be eaten.
DJ: Last year, Mom taught me how to make a picture-perfect pumpkin pie. So I can make that.
Stephanie: And I can help.
DJ: And I talked to Grandma last night on the phone and she was gonna put me in charge of the turkey anyway. So I can handle that too.
Stephanie: If I help.
Danny: DJ, you're right. Guys, we can do this. I am gonna make that stuffing.
Jesse: All right. And you know what? It just so happens I can do amazing things with a yam.
Joey: And in many parts of the world, I am known as Mr. Vegetable.
Danny: Give me my kid.
Joey: I'm feeling the miracle. The miracle...of Thanksgiving. Can you feel it?
Danny, Jesse, DJ & Stephanie: We feel it.
Joey: Yes. Are you ready?
Danny, Jesse, DJ & Stephanie: We're ready.
Joey: Now, let's cook.
Jesse: Let's take a walk around the table. Let's do that Temptation thing. All right, girls, let's go. Here we go.
Danny: We should have been the new Monkees.
Joey: Ladies and gentlemen, the miracle...of Thanksgiving.
Jesse: The little miracle-ette who made it all possible: DJ
DJ: Thank you. I couldn't have done it without you guys.
Danny: Okay. Guys, go carve the turkey. Ladies, please be seated at our Thanksgiving table.
Stephanie: Thank you.
Danny: Michelle, what are they gonna carve? Turkey. Turkey, turkey, turkey.
DJ: This is so much better than a restaurant.
Stephanie: Yeah, I hate those booster seats. They squeeze my tush.
Joey: Jess, we got a problem here.
Jesse: Let me try. It's frozen.
Danny: I had no idea you two were so good in the kitchen. The turkey, the pie. You should open a restaurant and support me the rest of my life.
Joey & Jesse: It's frozen. The thing's frozen.
DJ: I'm so glad this worked out so perfect. I wasn't sure if I could pull it off but it turned out just the way Mom cooked it last year. Do you think she would have been proud of me?
Danny: I'm sure she would have been, honey. Excuse me a second. I'll be right back. You two stay right here.
DJ: Is there something wrong with my turkey?
Jesse: No.
Joey: No, there's no turkey problem at all. This is a very happy bird.
Jesse: Yeah. He's happier than heck to be dead right here in our kitchen.
Danny: I'm just gonna shove that sucker back in the oven for just a couple more minutes.
DJ: Are you sure there's nothing wrong with it?
Danny: Of course, honey. You know what a nut I am about that extra-crispy skin.
DJ: Well, Dad, don't overcook it. You don't want it to get dry.
Danny: There's no danger of that happening, DJ Oh, my gosh. Someone's at the door. Who's gonna get it? I don't know. Let's all go get it.
Jesse: Let's all go get it.
Joey: Let's go see who came to visit us on Thanksgiving Day.


In the living room
Danny: Coming. Yes, yes, yes. Hi.
Paula: Hi.
Danny: Must be your friends, Jesse.
Jesse: No, not yet. Come in.
Paula: Hi, I'm Paula. And this is my sister Alexandra.
Danny: Hi, I'm Danny Tanner. These are my kids, Michelle, DJ and Stephanie. That's Jesse and Joey.
Jesse: Hi.
Joey: Hi.
DJ: Hi.
Stephanie: Hi. Who are you?
Alexandra: Isn't this 1882 Jerrard?
Joey: Jerrard Way, Avenue, Street, Place or Lane?
Alexandra: I'm not sure. Uncle Henry just moved to town.
Paula: Could we use your phone? We're already late, and this hot turkey's getting cold.
Danny: Hot turkey. Sure, come on in. There's the phone, right over there. Great. Girls, take Michelle and go upstairs and wash your hands.
Stephanie: Why? They're clean.
Danny: Yeah, but they're not Thanksgiving clean. Go, go, go. Go. Men, this is the miracle of Thanksgiving. That turkey was meant for us.
Jesse: I got a feeling that it may come as a surprise to the young ladies.
Danny: There's only one person who can convince these women to stay for dinner.
Jesse: I don't know, it's gonna be rough. It'd be easier if it was one girl with a chicken on Groundhog's Day.
Danny: Jesse, just think of little DJ's face when she goes into the kitchen and sees a turkey ice sculpture in the oven.
Jesse: All right, I'll give it a shot. But I'll need a few things. You, you dim the lights. Joey, go get some drinks.
Joey: I'll get us some traditional pumpkin margaritas. All right, I'll surprise you.
Jesse: Get out of...
Paula: Thank you. I'm sorry if we interrupted your dinner.
Jesse: Dinner? What a coincidence. I was just gonna talk about dinner. Why spend dinner over Uncle Hank's house which, by the way, you can't even find...when fate has dropped you and your bird, if you will, here in our laps?
Alexandra: Because our husbands wouldn't like it.
Jesse: Ball's in your court.
Danny: I'll give you $100 for that turkey.
Paula: Excuse me?
Danny: $125.
Alexandra: You wanna buy our turkey?
Jesse: You bet, $140.
Paula: This is crazy.
Danny: $150.
Paula: Let's talk.


In the kitchen
Joey: Oh, no.
Danny: Joey.
Joey: Just a minute.
Alexandra: What planet have we landed on?
Paula: I'm not sure, but I think I hear Uncle Henry calling. Good luck.
Danny: Wait, $175, you can keep the stuffing. $200.
Jesse: What is it, Lassie? What is it, girl? Did Grandpa fall in the river again? What? Oh, my God.
Danny: We can't even see.
Jesse: All right, be careful. It's on-- The thing's on fire.
DJ: Oh, my gosh.
Danny: I love that crispy skin.
DJ: What happened?
Danny: It's all my fault, honey. Your turkey was a little frozen, so I shoved it in the oven and I cranked it up all the way.
DJ: My turkey was frozen?
Danny: DJ, it's all my fault.
DJ: It was frozen. I didn't defrost it enough.
Stephanie: Don't feel bad. At least, we still can have the--Pie.
DJ: Tell me that didn't happen.
Stephanie: That didn't happen.
DJ: Yes, it did.
Stephanie: I ruined Mom's picture-perfect pumpkin pie.
DJ: And I ruined the turkey.
Danny: I'm gonna go talk to DJ
Jesse: All right.
Joey: And I'll go talk to Stephanie.
Jesse: Whoa, I'll talk to Stephanie. Here, you take Michelle. Oh, by the way, you got a bottle stuck on your tongue.
Joey: Another miracle...of Thanksgiving.
Michelle: Turkey.


In Danny's room
DJ: Dad, you don't have to tell me. I know I ruined Thanksgiving for everyone.
Danny: You didn't ruin anything.
DJ: I let Mom down.
Danny: Why? Because of the turkey? DJ, Mom knew Thanksgiving wasn't about turkeys. It's about family...and about being thankful for what we have. I'm thankful I've got you. You're the one who pulled us all together tonight.
DJ: You're just trying to make me feel better.
Danny: Is it working?
DJ: No.
Danny: You think you feel bad. I feel worse.
DJ: You couldn't.
Danny: Oh, yeah? Wait till I tell you what's been going on. I felt so bad about your frozen turkey...that I offered those ladies $200 for theirs.
DJ: Dad, that's crazy. You should've just told me the truth and given me the $200. That would've made me feel better.
Danny: Thanks for making me feel better.
DJ: You're welcome.
Danny: Sometimes you remind me so much of your mom. You always have a smile for me when I need one.
DJ: Yeah, well, like Mom said, smiles are free, so give them away.

In DJ & Stephanie's room
Stephanie: Uncle Jesse, are you still here?
Jesse: No, I left. You can come out of the closet now.
Stephanie: Nice try.
Jesse: All right, that's it. I'm coming in there with you. Look out.
Stephanie: I...broke the pie.
Jesse: That's all right. People break things all the time. It's okay, no big deal. Everybody makes mistakes.
Stephanie: Not pie mistakes.
Jesse: Even pie mistakes. You know what, I'll show you a mistake I made when I was your age. Hop on my back, I'll give you a piggyback ride. Hop on. There we go. It's kind of fun hanging out in the closet.
Stephanie: You don't get out much, do you?


In Jesse's room
Jesse: All right, come here. Now you settle down here...and be prepared to be amazed at my stupidity. Here, come on, sit on my lap.
Stephanie: Okay.
Jesse: Take a look at that.
Stephanie: Who's that goofy-looking guy with silly hair and big ears?
Jesse: I don't have big ears.
Stephanie: They're fine now that your head's bigger. Why is your hair so lopsided?
Jesse: That's the thing, see. When I was 5 and your mom was 10...I let her cut my hair because she said she was in beauty school.
Stephanie: And you believed her?
Jesse: Well, I said I was 5.
Stephanie: I'm 5, and I wouldn't fall for that.
Jesse: Well, maybe you're just a little smarter han I am, huh, you little ankle-biter? Look at this one.
Stephanie: Oh, yeah.
Jesse: Hey.
Stephanie: Who's that little girl with you?
Jesse: That's your mommy. She's pretty, isn't she?
Stephanie: Yeah. What's she holding?
Jesse: Well, in one hand she's holding her scissors...and in the other hand she's holding about 95 percent of my hair.
Stephanie: Oh, yeah, that's for Halloween, huh?
Danny: How you guys doing?
Jesse: We're cool.
Stephanie: We're fine.
DJ: Let's go have some black turkey and some pie a' la floor.
Stephanie: Okay, but can we make a new pie?
DJ: Sure, Steph.
Stephanie: I promise not to drop it.
DJ: And I promise not to freeze it.
Danny: Okay, let's go.
Stephanie: Okay, come on. Let's go eat.
DJ: I'm hungry.
Jesse: You missed a great Thanksgiving, sis.
Danny: You coming?
Jesse: Yeah. Yeah, let's go.
Danny: Wait, look at this. I forgot how much the girls look like Pam when she was their age.
Jesse: Yeah, right. Come on, let's go, man.
Danny: Wait a second, you wanna talk?
Jesse: No, why would I wanna talk? Come on, let's go.
Danny: Jesse. It's okay if you're hurting.
Jesse: I'm not hurting, I'm hungry. I wanna go eat. Let's go, please.
Danny: I hadn't thought about this. But this must be real hard on you. You spent more Thanksgivings with Pam than any of us.
Jesse: What's it take to get through to you? I don't wanna have this conversation. So leave me alone.
Danny: Okay. Fine. I'll just be moseying along. But if you wanna talk, you know my home number.
Jesse: When is it gonna stop hurting, man? I keep thinking the pain's gonna go away...but it doesn't. I see pictures, I think of her...I get this feeling, this em--
Danny: I know that feeling, Jesse. And I don't think it ever completely goes away. Sometimes it's easier...but on days like this, it's real hard. But you don't have to go through this alone.
Jesse: I'm missing her, man. This-- It's so hard for me to talk about it.
Danny: Talking about it, that's what helps me. Talking about the memories. That's what keeps her in your heart.
Jesse: Yeah?
Danny: Yeah.
Jesse: Everybody knows the story of how I got my hair all chopped up and everything...but I'll bet you don't know how I retaliated. Look at this. Did you ever see your wife with red, white and blue hair?
Danny: I think she looked cute. How'd you do this?
Jesse: Picture this, it was the middle of the night...two things of finger paints and vanilla pudding. I was a wicked little 5-year-old, wasn't I?
Danny: I'm glad you're here, Jesse.

In the kitchen
Danny: Lord, as we gather this Thanksgiving...we wanna thank you for this bountiful...yet slightly overcooked, reheated meal.
Everybody: Amen.
Danny: But what we're most thankful for...is being part of a family who really loves each other.
Everybody: Amen.
Jesse: And God bless my mom and dad who are in Orange County with all my dad's goofy relatives.
Everybody: Amen.
Joey: And I'd just like to say I'm happy to be part of this family and God bless my dad and his third wife...Janice. And to my mom who's on a Thanksgiving gambling junket to Atlantic City: Seven come eleven, Mom.
Everybody: Amen.
DJ: Carve the turkey, Dad.
Danny: My pleasure. Okay, who wants white meat?
DJ: I do. I want some.
Stephanie: Me.
Danny: Scratch the white meat. We have dark meat and really dark meat.
Jesse: Yeah.
Stephanie: All right.
